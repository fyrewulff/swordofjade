There are autoset tag conditions in the Item and Hero editors. You can use multiple conditions to turn on the same tag. An autoset tag is turned on while any of the conditions are met, and turned off if none of them are. The tags are immediately turned on and off when anything happens (e.g. a textbox) that might require an update, so if you try to set them manually they will go back to the automatic value at some later time. The Edit Tags menu shows all autoset conditions for each tag. But don't mix hero and item autoset conditions for the same tag, it won't work correctly.
