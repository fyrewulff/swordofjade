Here you can customize how an attack animation aligns with a target.

By default, the attack will be centered, but sometimes you don't want that.

For best results, test out your alignment on enemies of different sizes.

For projectile attack animations, the alignment is just the point where the attack will aim towards (or come from, in the case of a reverse projectile)
