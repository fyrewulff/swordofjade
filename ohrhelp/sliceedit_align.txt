The alignment setting controls which edge of this slice's parent the slice will be positioned relative to.

Remember, alignment is relative to the parent slice.

Any padding that the parent slice has affects the position of the alignment point.

If a slice is set to Fill Parent vertically, horizontally or both then the corresponding Align, Anchor and Clamp options do nothing (they are overridden) and are hidden.
