This global text string is used to display amounts of money such as prices and how much you have.

The string should contain # which is replaced with the amount.

For example "$#" can become "$10", "# gold" can become "10 gold".

The string is also used to display the name of the currency in some editors, like attack "Gold Cost: ..."
