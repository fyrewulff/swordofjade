You are editing the position or size of a slice, or shifting the position the slice collection on the screen (which is only a temporary change, it doesn't change the slice collection).

Press arrow keys to change the position/size, and hold down Shift to move more quickly.

Press F7 to toggle whether the slice outline is shown.
