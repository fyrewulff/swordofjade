This is the Password Editor.

Hm, well the screen says it all. Type in a password if you like (the new password is blank by default), and press ENTER to confirm it. Press ESC to cancel.

If you forget your password, and it had actually been of some use for security, you would have been in trouble. Thankfully, the password feature does not really afford any extra "security", and if you ask one of the developers at the OHR wiki for help they can easily recover your password for you.
