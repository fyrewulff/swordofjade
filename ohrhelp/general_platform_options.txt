The options on this screen only matter if your game is being played on an Android device such as a phone, a tablet, or an OUYA console.

When games are played on a phone or a tablet, a virtual gamepad overlay will appear on the screen with a D-Pad in the bottom left for the arrow keys, and buttons in the bottom-right.

"Disable Virtual Gamepad" allows you to disable this overlay for games that are purely mouse-based. (The virtual gamepad is disabled automatically on OUYA, so you do NOT need to set this option for OUYA compatibility)

Some Android devices, such as the OUYA Console or the XPeria Play have gamepads, and most newer android devices can use a USB or Bluetooth controller, such as an XBox or Playstation controller.

Press ENTER to choose a new keyboard key to map to a controller button. 

Press DELETE or BACKSPACE to revert the button back to the default.

It is strongly recommended to leave button A mapped to ENTER and button B mapped to ESC, this will allow you to navigate menus and text boxes.

"Console TV Safe Margin" only matters if your game is being played on a Console, like the OUYA. A margin will be added around the edge of the screen, because some televisions crop things at the edge of the screen. Most games should leave this unchanged, but if you want to handle TV safe zones yourself, you can change this value to something other than "Default"
