Choose the base attack stat, and press ENTER or SPACE. Pressing ESC cancels.

Base attack stat controls how much damage the attack will do.

You can chose any stat of the target or the attacker.

Here are a few special base stats:

  100  If you want an attack to do a
       specific amount of damage
       regardless of stats, use this
       as your base stat. You can
       then adjust "Extra Damage%"
       to customise the specific
       amount.

  Random 1-999
       Base damage will be a random          number. You can cutsomize the
       range using"Extra Damage%"

  Previous Attack
       Base damage will be the actual
       damage of the last attack
       performed by this attacker.

  Last damage to (Revenge)
       Base damage will be the last
       actual damage infliced to the
       attacker or the target
       regardless of who inflicted it

  Last cure to (Thankvenge)
       Base damage will be the last
       cure applied to the target.

When choosing a stat for base damage, you normally do not want to use the "Max" stat. Max stats as base damage will ignore any buffs or debuffs to that stat.
