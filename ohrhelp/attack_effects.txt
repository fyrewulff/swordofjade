Additional effects when the attack is used.

Changing the target control can be used to put an enemy under player control.

If a hero or enemy has turncoat status, that affects who they will be able to target with their attacks.

If a hero or enemy has defector status, that affects which side they are grouped with for the purposes of other's attacks.

Defector status also means that the enemy does not need to be killed for the battle to end.

To make a hero behave like an enemy, set:
 Control=acts automatically
 Turncoat=attacks allies
 Defector=changes sides

To make an enemy behave like a hero, set:
 Control=Controlled by Player
 Turncoat=attacks allies
 Defector=changes sides
