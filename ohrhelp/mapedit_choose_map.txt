This menu allows you to choose which map you want to work on. Just use the Up and Down arrow keys (or PgDn, PgUp, Home, and End) to select a map, or type a map number or part of a map name, and press ENTER or SPACE to start editing it.

You can press ESC to go back to the previous menu.

If you want to add a new map, highlight "Add a New Map" at the bottom of the menu, and press ENTER or SPACE.
