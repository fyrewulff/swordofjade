This is a menu for experimenting with combined tag/global variable conditions.

The top two and bottom two conditions vary in the action of Enter/Space when the condition is a tag.

In each pair, the conditions vary in whether they default to Always or Never.

Condition controls:

Type in or edit a condition any way you please, using numbers, <, >, =, Backspace, Left and Right.

Press Tab to switch between editing the global number and the value.

Typing ! inverts a condition. Also, typing - inverts a tag check.

Hit Enter to enter an editor where you can choose the type of condition.

Press Delete to remove a condition.
