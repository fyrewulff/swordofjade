This is the main map editor menu. Use the arrow keys (or PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End) to navigate the menu, or type part of a menu item to jump to, and press ENTER or SPACE to enter the menu. See the various help files in each sub-menu for more info.

At the bottom of the menu you can type in a name for the map.

Use "Erase Map Data" only with caution. Erasing map data cannot be undone, so make a backup copy of your RPG file first if you are not certain.
