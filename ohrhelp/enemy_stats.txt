MP: Magic points. The enemy consumes these points when using certain attacks.

Strength: This affects how much damage the enemy can deal to you.

Accuracy: This affects how often the enemy's attacks will miss. If it is much lower that the hero's "Dodge" then the enemy's attacks are more likely to miss.

Defense: This reduces the damage that you inflict to the enemy.

Dodge: This affects how often your attacks will miss the enemy. If it is mich higher than your "Accuracy", then your attacks are more likelly to miss.

Magic: Like strength, this affects how much damage certain attacks deal.

Will: Like "Defense", this reduces the damage done by attacks that are based on "Magic" instead of "Strength"

Counter: This does not currently have any specifically defined purpose, but you can use it as a base stat for your attacks in various ways.
