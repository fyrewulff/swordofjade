This is the main menu of the Shop Editor. Shops include Inns and also places to "hire" new heroes.

Up and Down arrow keys (or PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End) navigate the menu.

Press the Left and Right arrow keys on the shop number to change which shop you are editing.

Press ENTER or SPACE to open the various submenus.

You can give the shop a name here.

The first submenu you should enter will probably be the Edit Shop Bitsets menu, where you can decide what services are available at this shop.

Choose Edit Available Stuff to choose the shop's stock if the shop sells things (when Buy, Sell, or Hire are available in the Shop Menu Items menu).

If the shop includes an inn (under Select Shop Menu Items) then you can set the price here, and optionally set a script to be run if the player stays here.
