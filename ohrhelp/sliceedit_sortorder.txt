This value only has any effect when the parent of this slice is set to "Auto-sort children: Custom". Then it determines the order of this slice: lower values get sorted to the bottom (first children, drawn first) and higher values to the top (later children, drawn last).

If the parent doesn't have Auto-sort: Custom set, then "(N/A)" is displayed.
