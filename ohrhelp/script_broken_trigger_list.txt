This screen shows any places in your game where you have set a script to be called that no longer exists.

You cannot fix the problem here; this is merely to see at a glance where broken script triggers are set in your game. You should go to the proper editor and change the trigger there.

Navigate with the Up and Down arrow keys (or PgUp, PgDn, Home, and End).

Select "Export to File" to save the contents of this screen to a text file.

Press ESC to return to the Script Management menu.
