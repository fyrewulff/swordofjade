Choose a hand position on the sprite. This will be matched to the "handle position" defined for weapons in the Item Editor when the hero attacks in battle.

Move the flashing cursor with the arrow keys (hold SHIFT to go faster), by right clicking, or by dragging with the left mouse button, and press ENTER or SPACE or LEFT CLICK to confirm a position.
