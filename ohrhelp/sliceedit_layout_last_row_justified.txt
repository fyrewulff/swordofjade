This controls the justification of the final row of a layout slice. If YES, the final row is treated like all others, but if there are only a couple items on the final row, then they might be splaced waaaay apart.
If NO, then extra spacing can still used on the final row, but no more than the row above, so it doesn't look odd.
(If there's only one row, no spacing is used).
