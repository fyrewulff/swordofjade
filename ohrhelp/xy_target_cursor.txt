This is the Cursor Offset positioner. This is where the cursor will appear in game when a player is targetting this enemy.

Move the flashing cursor with the arrow keys (hold SHIFT to go faster), by right clicking, or by dragging with the left mouse button, and press ENTER or SPACE or LEFT CLICK to confirm a position.
