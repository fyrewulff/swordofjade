A scroll slice looks at its children to determine the size of the area that it should scroll over.

When this is set to "No Limit" then all child slices will be used.

You can also limit the scroll to only consider a limited number of generations of children.

1 = only consider children
2 = consider children + grandchildren
3 = consider children + grandchildren
    + great grandchildren
