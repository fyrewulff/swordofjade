This is the text box choice editor. Here you can create a tiny menu with two choices that will pop up when the text box is displayed.

For example, to make a simple yes/no question, set Choice = Enabled.

Then set Option 0 text to "Yes" and option 1 text to "No".

Press ENTER or SPACE to change the set tag for each choice. You could use the same tag number, but make option 0 turn the tag ON while option 1 turns the tag OFF.

Press - to switch between setting the tag ON or OFF.
