This is where you define maptile animations.

Press left and right on "Animation set" to choose which set you are going to edit. There are only two animation sets for each tileset, and they are numbered 0 and 1.

The "Animation Range" is the set of tiles that are allowed to use this animation. This is an engine limitation.

The "Animation Pattern" is a series of simple commands that describe the animation.

You can also specify a tag that can be used to disable the animation.
