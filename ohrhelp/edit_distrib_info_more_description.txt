If the single paragraph "Description" is not long enough for you, you can put the rest of your description here. It can be as long as you want.

This is a good place to describe how to play, include credits and special thanks, or anything else you want to include in your README file.

Press ENTER to edit the description in multiline mode.

While in multiline mode, you can press:

F2 - save the description to a text file

F3 - import text from a text file
