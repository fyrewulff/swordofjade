This is zone triggers editor. Here you can change what a zone actually does.

As you can see, no triggers are implemented yet! However, in the NPC editor, you can set a movement zone which restricts where an NPC can move.

The zone name is for your convenience, it does nothing in-game. It can be read with the "get zone name" script command though.

Extra data can be read with the script command "get zone extra". It has no built-in meaning.
