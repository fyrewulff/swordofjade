This menu shows a hero's spell lists. Heroes can have up to four.

Use the Up and Down arrow keys to navigate the menu. Press ENTER to begin editing a spell list, or type to name them directly.

Spell lists with blank names are hidden during play, so you control how many spell lists a hero has by how many you name. Note that you can also edit the hero's battle menu to hide spell lists, or give them attacks that aren't on a spell list.
