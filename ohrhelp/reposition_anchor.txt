The anchor point of a menu is the point that is used when positioning the menu. If the menu shrinks or grows it will shrink or grow relative to this point.

Use the arrow keys to move the flashing anchor point, and press ESC when you are finished.

The anchor point can be on any corner, any edge, or in the center.
