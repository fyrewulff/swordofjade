Here you choose which of the Panel's two children will be the primary one,
either index 0 (the first) or 1 the (the second).

The primary child is the one for which you choose a size in percentage and/or pixels.

The other non-primary child will get whatever space is left over.

If the panel has more than two children, they don't appear, as if they weren't visible.
