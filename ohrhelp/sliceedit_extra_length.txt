The length of the 'extra' array, which defaults to 3.

You can set a maximum length of 5,000,000, although I don't know why you'd do that in the slice editor!

If you wan to increase the length without erasing existing values be careful not to press Backspace!

You can also use the "resize slice extra" command to change the length.
