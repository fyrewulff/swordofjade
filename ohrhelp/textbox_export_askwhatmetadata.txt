Text: This is all the actual text of
   each text box.

Conditionals: This includes all tag
   data and actions and information
   about how boxes are connected to
   each other.

Choices: This includes the simple
   optional two-choice pop-up
   questions.

Appearance: This includes color,
   border portrait and other visual
   presentation data.

If you are exporting your text boxes for a backup copy, definitely include everything.

If you are exporting just so you can run your text boxes through a spellchecker, then just the text should be enough.

If in doubt, go ahead and include everything.
