# swordofjade-scripts
The scripts that power Sword of Jade in general, includes cutscenes, battle stuff, and it's time system.

You will need to import these scripts into Sword of Jade to make use of them.



Usage of scripts: You may use, adapt, and remix these scripts for your own game with no credit, attribution, or payment. While attribution to Kevin Loan and Michael Kidder is appreciated if you use a significant chunk of the scripts is nice, it is not required.

While the engine Sword of Jade runs on is GPL, these scripts are not.

Note that if you want to compile these scripts for the MS-DOS version of the game, you will need to use the Windows HSPEAK compiler, as the MS-DOS compiler will run out of memory.

These scripts in their current state will compile for the MS-DOS, Windows, Linux, Mac, and Android versions of the game.
