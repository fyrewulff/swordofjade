[\226 Wanderer]
     I apologize about the bed, how
much do I owe you?
======================================
Box 3
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     The bed! What about me? You
could have killed me!
======================================
Box 4
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     I could have, but did not. I am
sorry.
======================================
Box 5
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     Hmph! The day is already half
over and I went to check on you, to
find you tossing and turning like you
were fighting some monster\175
======================================
Box 6
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     And this is the thanks I get:
a bed, ruined!
======================================
Box 7
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     \175Thank you for waking me up?
======================================
Box 8
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     That's better. I really meant to
give you this note, but I didn't know
you were planning to kill me.
======================================
Box 9
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     For the last time, I am sorry.
I have no desire to kill you. Do you
know who it is from?
======================================
Box 10
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     She wished to remain anonymous.
======================================
Box 11
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     Ah, so it is a she.
======================================
Box 12
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     No, no, no, did I say she? It
could be a he, she, whatever. That's
what anonymous means, silly.
======================================
Box 13
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     But you said \185she'.
======================================
Box 14
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     Did not!
======================================

--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     Okay, but{}
======================================
Box 16
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     Did not, did not, did not! She's
anonymous; you're not suppose to know
or else she won't be very anonymous,
now will she be?
======================================

======================================

--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     Thanks for the note. Here is all
the money I have, I hope it is enough
to pay for the bed. Good day.

[\209 Innkeeper]
     Hey! Uh, you are a protector,
correct?
======================================
Box 23
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     Yeah\175 I used to be. How did you
know?
======================================
Box 24
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     Gee, she was right, you're not
too quick, said you'd sleep all day
if I didn't go try and wake you.
======================================
Box 25
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     That note has your name in it.
I couldn't help taking a peek, you
must be here to kill the wolf.
======================================
Box 26
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     The wolf?
======================================
Box 27
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     Yes, the wolf. I've heard rumors
of a wolf monster who steals things,
even children, who is only seen in
moonlight, who\175
======================================
Box 28
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     \175It is very frightening to talk
about such things. Now I will have
nightmares tonight for sure!
======================================
Box 29
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     You shouldn't worry about rumors.
======================================
Box 30
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     I fear for the safety of Fralin.
Many people have already moved away.
======================================
Box 31
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     I am leaving myself, good day.
======================================
Box 32
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     Good day. Thanks for the ruined
bed and nightmares!
======================================

[\211 Scarf]
     We're in the keep, what now?
======================================
Box 35
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     We look for the source.
======================================
Box 36
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Whatever is in there will not
remain quiet for long. We have it
trapped.
======================================
Box 37
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     I don't like the setup.
======================================
Box 38
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Whatever it is, it has led us
here. The thing has burrowed itself
into this stick-hole.
======================================
Box 39
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     We might be walking into a trap.
======================================
Box 40
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I have a bad feeling about this.
======================================
Box 41
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I don't think I can last much
longer. The monsters are stronger
here.
======================================
Box 42
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     You are doing fine. Stay close
and stay focused.
======================================
Box 43
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Are you sure you need me?
======================================
Box 44
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     We need all the protectors we
can get. This is not going to be
pretty.
======================================
Box 45
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Ha-ha, I will make it look
pretty. Keep your chin up!
======================================
Box 46
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     We are the people's hope and
future.
======================================
Box 47
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     The other protectors still have
their own areas to defend.
======================================
Box 48
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     We have nothing left.

     We will need to find some key or
device to open it.

[\211 Scarf]
     Inaccessable, perhaps the corpses
can tell us how to pass.

     It won't open, we can't get
through.

     Then we will either find a way

     Stop hiding, I know you're there.
You've been following me since I left
Fralin.

[? ????]
     I've been following you for
longer than that, but you never seem
to notice.

[\200 Dogero]
     Mi'la? Is that you?
======================================
Box 103
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Of course it's me! You always
were a tad slow\175 though we haven't
seen each other in quite some time.
======================================
Box 104
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What are you doing here?
======================================
Box 105
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I don't know\175 the forest seems
rather nice today, reminds me of the
one we grew up in.
======================================
Box 106
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     But you probably don't remember,
as you're stupid.
======================================

[\200 Dogero]
     Why have you been following me?
======================================

     Why were you scaring those kids?
You're such a monster.
======================================

     I'll forgive you if you walk
through the forest with me, wouldn't
want you to get hurt.

     Mi'la\175 quit playing around. Why
are you here?
======================================
Box 111

[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh, no reason really. I was
about to ask you the same question.
======================================
Box 112
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I received a note from an
anonymous person that told me to meet
him in the Forest Pass alone.
======================================
Box 113
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Wow! That sounds really
important, I wonder what it could be
about?
======================================
Box 114

[\200 Dogero]
     I think it might be about
Fralin's wolf monster problem.
======================================

     This person seems to want my
help, though I don't understand why
she has to be so secretive about it.

to you as a hero.

mood, you can tag along with me and
we can solve this problem together.
======================================
Box 121

[\201 Mi'la]
     How about it? My tracking skills
are far better than yours; we're
guaranteed to find whoever sent you
that note with me around!
======================================
Box 122
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Okay, I guess your help might be
better than no help.
======================================
Box 123

[\201 Mi'la]
     Excellent choice! We can't lose
with all my talent and skill. What
are you waiting for? Let's go!

     Is it too late for me to change

don't hate you.

a tear over you, Dogerdumb! I don't
need you, I don't need anyone!

without me, I don't care.

ugly goddess.

the big bad wolf monster or not? This
abandoned tomb would make the perfect
hiding spot for it.

     So? What about my letter? What
about the person I'm suppose to meet?

matter now! All that matters is we

letter, you've already found what you
needed to find.

Box 153
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Or would he rather go on
adventures! Fight monsters! Save
himself and everyone he loves!
======================================
Box 154
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Is he someone who would rather
right wrongs or allow problems to
make him miserable and{}
======================================
Box 155
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Okay, okay!
======================================
Box 156
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Fine, you win. Let's go.
======================================
Box 157
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Wouldn't you rather forget about
all of this and go have a few drinks
at the bar in Fralin?
======================================
Box 158
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's go.
======================================
Box 159
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     How about sleeping all day in
the inn?
======================================
Box 160
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's go!
======================================
Box 161
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Why are you here?
======================================
Box 162
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Do you know where here is?
======================================
Box 163
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Can't you ever just answer my
questions?
======================================
Box 164
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     This is the entrance to an
underground tomb.
======================================
Box 165
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Being abandoned, it would make
a great hideout for those who like to
terrorize towns by moonlight, don't
you think?
======================================
Box 166
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Perhaps, but I cannot know for
sure. The monster might not be down
there and besides, I need to find
whoever wrote this letter.
======================================
Box 167
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You are such an idiot.
======================================
Box 168
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh! I cannot know for sure if
the monster is down there, so I'll
just wander aimlessly for the rest of
my life looking{}
======================================
Box 169
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It would appear as if you are
mocking me.
======================================
Box 170
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     {}Looking, looking, when instead
I should be looking in there so I can
know for sure if the monster is there
or not.
======================================
Box 171
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You seem to have a point.
======================================
Box 172
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No! I have a point{}I do not
seem anything!
======================================
Box 173
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     So, you are suggesting we
investigate this place?
======================================
Box 174
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Yeah, took you long enough to
figure that one out, slow poke.
======================================
Box 175
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Sorry, I have other things to do.
======================================
Box 176
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Like what?
======================================
Box 177
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Well, what?
======================================
Box 178
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Good! Let's go.
======================================
Box 179

[\200 Dogero]
     But\175
======================================
Box 180
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No buts, you're going down there
and that's that.
======================================
Box 181
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Don't I have a choice?
======================================
Box 182
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Yes, you do have a choice. You
can either come with me and be alive
or idle away and be miserable.
======================================
Box 183
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Let's go!
======================================

======================================
Box 185
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     I still cannot believe that was
Dogero.
======================================
Box 186
--------------------------------------
[\204 ????]
     Believe it.
======================================
Box 187
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     Don't you remember the stories
about him? He's saved towns from
monsters before.
======================================
Box 188
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     Remember the one where he was
thrown in jail for laughing at the
town's general assembly, calling them
all sheep\175
======================================
Box 189
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     \175Just to break out and save the
town from the biggest jelleclop ever
with his bare hands?
======================================
Box 190
--------------------------------------
[\204 ????]
     I do. He must have changed.
======================================
Box 191
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     I think he is still the same.
People don't change, not people like
him.
======================================
Box 192
--------------------------------------
[\204 ????]
     Something must have happened to
him.
======================================
Box 193
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     Maybe, we should keep an eye on
him along with Lycant.
======================================
Box 194
--------------------------------------
[\204 ????]
     Okay.
======================================
Box 195
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     I have to go. Folks will worry
if I'm gone from Fralin for too long.
======================================
Box 196
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     And they'd really worry if they
knew we were hanging around Grinlow
Spiral.
======================================
Box 197
--------------------------------------
[\204 ????]
     Yeah.
======================================
Box 198
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     See you later.

     Hmm. He told us to enjoy our
lives before Gahn comes\175
======================================
Box 201
--------------------------------------
[\204 ????]
     I don't understand.
======================================
Box 202
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Be still and know I have come
for you.
======================================
Box 203
--------------------------------------
[\204 ????]
     Who are you?
======================================
Box 204
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     I am the voice of fellowship,
the spirit of goodwill, the caretaker
of the needy.
======================================
Box 205
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     I myself am nothing, nothing but
the sum of all those who have faith
in me.
======================================
Box 206
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Is this absolutely necessary?
======================================
Box 207
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     There is no such thing as
absolute anything, my friend.
======================================
Box 208
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     This boy's life now has a
purpose. To live, one must be ready
to die. His death shall redeem us all.
======================================
Box 209
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Blissful ignorance! He is running
away! Does he not know that children
of all people are not allowed to run
away?
======================================
Box 210
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I do not see the point in this.
======================================
Box 211
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     That is because you rely too much
on seeing. Nothing is so beautiful to
see as the unseen glory and depth in
this child's sacrifice.
======================================
Box 212
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I don't understand, how can this
child be more useful dead than alive?
======================================
Box 213
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Close your eyes and open the
eyes of your anima. All life is
precious; there is no higher life
than another.
======================================
Box 214
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     This child, rest his soul, has a
mother, someone Dogero and you have
both known before as pups.
======================================
Box 215
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     With his sacrifice, she will be
much more willing and able to aid us
in changing the world. We cannot do
such without many hands.
======================================
Box 216
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     You're going to use her to kill
Dogero?
======================================
Box 217
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     No, no, don't be so shortsighted.
With the mindset Dogero has now, he
is no threat to anyone but himself.
======================================
Box 218
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     But this child's mother, she
will make a fine incindiary for our
liberation of this land. Think of her
as insurance, another hand.
======================================
Box 219
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I know this is the only way, but\175
======================================
Box 220
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     I know that; patience, my strong
right arm, patience! You will have
your happiness, we all will once I
succeed.
======================================
Box 221
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     I only have the best intentions
of the world in mind.
======================================
Box 222
--------------------------------------
======================================
Box 223
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     I told you the setup is bad.
======================================
Box 224
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     What is that smell? I can hardly
breathe in here.
======================================
Box 225
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     These corpses smell as if they
have only been dead a day at most.
======================================
Box 226
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Make me vomit already!
======================================
Box 227
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     They look like they have been
dead for years. Maybe we should leave
and rethink this.
======================================
Box 228
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Stay focused! We got here by
thinking and we will get out by
thinking.
======================================
Box 229
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Scarf's right, we did not come
this far to run away. Keep to the
plan.
======================================
Box 230
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I don't know how much longer I
can last, my mind is running in
circles.
======================================
Box 231
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I'm scared too but I'm not
leaving, not until we find what we
are looking for.
======================================
Box 232
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     We can run away in fear together
afterward, okay?
======================================
Box 233
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Okay.
======================================
Box 234
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Remember your training and let's
make our master proud.
======================================
Box 235
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Let's slow down.
======================================
Box 236
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Get ready\175
======================================
Box 237
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Animated corpses, should have
seen this coming.
======================================
Box 238
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Yikes, this is bad, but we won't
go down without a fight!
======================================
Box 239
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     This doesn't look good\175
======================================
Box 240
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Wait, I need a moment to calm
down.
======================================
Box 241
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Do you always have such anxiety
when doing this?
======================================
Box 242
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Always.
======================================
Box 243
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     It makes you look weak. Hide your
fear with power, that is the only way
to become stronger.
======================================
Box 244
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I'll try.
======================================
Box 245
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     We should send someone ahead,
lest we walk right into the belly of
the beast.
======================================
Box 246
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I'm on it.
======================================
Box 247
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     You okay?
======================================
Box 248
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I'm better.
======================================
Box 249
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I never knew you were like this.
I should have seen it but didn't.
======================================
Box 250
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Sorry for not telling you in
advance. I don't think I'm cut out
for this kind of stuff.
======================================
Box 251
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Talk like that and you never
will be.
======================================
Box 252
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     If you think yourself a failure,
you will be one, regardless if you
are or not. That is how this works.
======================================
Box 253
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I know, I know\175 but this isn't
easy.
======================================
Box 254
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Then make it easy. You are
blocking your own path.
======================================
Box 255
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I have seen what you can do and
you have nothing to be afraid of.
======================================
Box 256
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Besides, you were always his
favorite pupil. We all could see that.
======================================
Box 257
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Scarf looks as nervous as you.
======================================
Box 258
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Thinking about things I like
helps unnerve me.
======================================
Box 259
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     \175
======================================
Box 260
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     What's wrong?
======================================
Box 261
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I feel bad about leaving Katina
behind. I hope she isn't dead.
======================================
Box 262
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Okay, maybe that was not the
best advice for this particular
situation.
======================================
Box 263
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No, it helps. I have to find out
what happened to her.
======================================
Box 264
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Don't let that blind you, I mean,
it is okay to attach yourself but not
too\175 I mean, don't, um\175
======================================
Box 265
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Don't worry, I understand. Stay
focused, right?
======================================
Box 266
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Right, focused. Focus is key.
======================================
Box 267
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Focus is life!
======================================
Box 268
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Don't tell him, but sometimes
Dart scares me.
======================================
Box 269
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Text and pictures, I can only
make out a little of it.
======================================
Box 270
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It is about the monster that
made this place. Grinlow\175
======================================
Box 271
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     The language is ancient; it is a
crude form of the one used today.
======================================
Box 272
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No one has been here for
centuries. No one in their right mind
would, or at least no one who knows
history.
======================================
Box 273
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What am I doing here?
======================================
Box 274
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     This place was not his keep but
his birthplace, though he did have it
built into one eventually.
======================================
Box 275
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     He made this a "monument
everlasting" for those to "remember
and suffer". I can't make out the
rest.
======================================
Box 276
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I cannot look at it anymore, I'm
afraid enough as it is.
======================================
Box 277
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I have to be strong.
======================================
Box 278
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     What did you find?
======================================
Box 279
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     The south leads to a room with
minor monsters, though I don't think
we will be able to get by without some
damage.
======================================
Box 280
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     The east leads to a huge monster
in chains. We could sneak by him, but
if he wakes up we'll be in trouble.
======================================
Box 281
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Both lead to the same set of
stairs.
======================================
Box 282
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Let's pick a path and go.
======================================
Box 283
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     The water smells corrosive. We
should avoid it as much as possible.
======================================
Box 284
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Hmm, looks like acid. Plot our
course with care.
======================================
Box 285
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Forgot to mention the strange
liquid.
======================================
Box 286
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     How can you forget something
like that!
======================================
Box 287
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Well, Scarfy, I didn't think it
a problem. So long as we are quick
about it, we'll survive.
======================================
Box 288
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Useless.
======================================
Box 289
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     The water looks bad.
======================================
Box 290
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     It probably is. Advance
carefully.
======================================
Box 291
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Quiet, tread softly.
======================================
Box 292
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Blast, here it comes!
======================================
Box 293
--------------------------------------
[\213 Monster]
     Will crush weaklings!
======================================
Box 294
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Careful, best not to wake it up.
======================================
Box 295
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     So much for the easy way.
======================================
Box 296
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Follow my lead. Slow is the
action and soft is the word.
======================================
Box 297
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Yikes! Even the best of us make
mistakes.
======================================
Box 298
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I don't like this\175
======================================
Box 299
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It's coming for us!
======================================
Box 300
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Quick! Make a run for it! Those
dead things woke up.
======================================
Box 301
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Don't have to tell me twice,
come on!
======================================
Box 302
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     This is it. I don't think we'll
make it.
======================================
Box 303
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Don't give up. Never give up!
There is always a way to win.
======================================
Box 304
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Well, if anyone knows the way
I'm all ears.
======================================
Box 305
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     They're getting ready to make a
go for it!
======================================
Box 306
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     The monster guarding the exit
frightens them. Perhaps we can use
that to our advantage\175 or make a run
for the stairs.
======================================
Box 307
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     They are running away as
expected. Come on.
======================================
Box 308
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Hah, suckers.
======================================
Box 309
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     That was beautiful! And
brilliant.
======================================
Box 310
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I don't believe it. I thought we
were going to die for sure.
======================================
Box 311
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     We do not allow fear to control
our action. That is the difference
between us and these monsters.
======================================
Box 312
--------------------------------------
[\219 Cookies]
     Cookies good imp, oh yes! Master
wants more people. Master loves
people.
======================================
Box 313
--------------------------------------
[\219 Cookies]
     Don't know how you got here or
how you got this far, but doesn't
matter, okay?
======================================
Box 314
--------------------------------------
[\219 Cookies]
     You die, goodbye!
======================================
Box 315
--------------------------------------
[\219 Cookies]
     Um, you attack now?
======================================
Box 316
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Please tell me you are joking.
Is that the best you can do?
======================================
Box 317
--------------------------------------
[\219 Cookies]
     Uh, um\175 this not supposed to
happen!
======================================
Box 318
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Yeah, you had us going there for
a moment. I mean, it's master faithful
servant, oh yes, cookies good imp.
======================================
Box 319
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Oh well, now you die!
======================================
Box 320
--------------------------------------
[\219 Cookies]
     Ack! You no want do that! I give
you things, okay?
======================================
Box 321

======================================
Box 322
--------------------------------------
[\219 Cookies]
     Oh, okay. But first I make
friends behind you attack, yes?
Attack, attack!
======================================
Box 323
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     He tricked us.
======================================
Box 324
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I hate imps. Come on, let's
chase him.
======================================
Box 325
--------------------------------------
[\219 Cookies]
     You stop chasing. I don't have
more tricks, honest!
======================================
Box 326
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I thought these things were
supposed to be clever, not honest.
======================================
Box 327
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     You think correctly.
======================================
Box 328
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     I'll handle this.
======================================
Box 329
--------------------------------------
[\219 Cookies]
     Ack, ack! This not good!
======================================
Box 330
--------------------------------------
[\219 Cookies]
     Um, um\175
======================================
Box 331
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     What a complete idiot.
======================================
Box 332
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     He chose to die instead of
facing us.
======================================
Box 333
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     A jelleclop monster\175
======================================
Box 334
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     It is clogging the stairway and
offending my nose.
======================================
Box 335
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     We will have to fight it to pass.
======================================
Box 336
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     There's no way around it?
======================================
Box 337
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Best to face problems head-on.
======================================
Box 338
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     It is empty.
======================================
Box 339
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     And quiet, despite what must be
a wild storm outside.
======================================
Box 340
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     This is it. The source of the
protector's problems is close.
======================================
Box 341
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I hope we are ready for it.
======================================
Box 342
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Ha! I hope it is ready for us.
======================================
Box 343
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I don't know about you but this
was a cakewalk compared to what I
was expecting.
======================================
Box 344
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Gahn did have a lot of faith in
us. A lot more than I had.
======================================
Box 345
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     The old man is all right. His
training has paid off.
======================================
Box 346
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     The weapons he gave us aren't
hurting either, they're great.
======================================
Box 347
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I wonder what we will find.
======================================
Box 348
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     We will find what we have been
looking for.
======================================
Box 349
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I hope we find Katina.
======================================
Box 350
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Stay focused, we aren't out of
this stick hole yet.
======================================
Box 351
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     It isn't a stick hole anymore.
The air is much better up here. I
feel a bit lightheaded, myself.
======================================
Box 352
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     The air isn't as thick this
high up.
======================================
Box 353
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I feel like I'm in a dream.
======================================
Box 354
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Snap out of it, we're almost
there.
======================================
Box 355
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     We will not fail having come
this far. I will not allow it!
======================================
Box 356
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I don't get it\175
======================================
Box 357
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Nothing's here! It's empty.
======================================
Box 358
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     This isn't right\175 I don't like
this.
======================================
Box 359
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Keep your eyes open.
======================================
Box 360
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Are you sure this is the source?
======================================
Box 361
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     It has to be.
======================================
Box 362
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Fralin was the first to go. You
came to me and the monsters followed.
======================================
Box 363
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Could it really be true then?
Grinlow has come back\175
======================================
Box 364
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     That's a scary thought.
======================================
Box 365
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Grinlow can't come back, he's
been dead for centuries.
======================================
Box 366
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     The imp said something about a
master. Maybe we missed something.
======================================
Box 367
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     We have not missed anything.
======================================
Box 368
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Whatever is here does not want
us to find it.
======================================
Box 369
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Maybe it lives in these clouds.
======================================
Box 370
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     No, what it has caused\175 it is
something very real, and very
dangerous.
======================================
Box 371
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     This evil cannot contain itself
here. It wants to spread, and it
wants to be found.
======================================
Box 372
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Show yourself!
======================================
Box 373
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     We have scaled your mountain!
We are still alive! Can you not strike
us down?
======================================
Box 374
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Answer me!
======================================
Box 375
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     No response.
======================================
Box 376
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Maybe we did miss something.
======================================
Box 377
--------------------------------------
             Forgive me.
======================================
Box 378
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     What was that!
======================================
Box 379
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You heard it too?
======================================
Box 380
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     I don't feel good.
======================================
Box 381
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     It's here.
======================================
Box 382
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     What are you doing here?
======================================
Box 383
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Hush child; enjoy the moment,
for such moments are rare.
======================================
Box 384
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     You should not have come here,
but you did, you should not have
left, but you did, you should not
have, but you did, you did\175
======================================
Box 385
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We should have stayed?
======================================
Box 386
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We are protectors, isn't this
protecting?
======================================
Box 387
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     You should have stayed to protect
those still alive, but you didn't.
======================================
Box 388
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Listen to the wind, it carries
their screams. They call for you.
======================================
Box 389
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     We only did what we thought was
right.
======================================
Box 390
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     You cannot claim morality as an
excuse.
======================================
Box 391
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     What about those suffering in
need of the skills given to you?
======================================
Box 392
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     People have died in the name of
what you think is right.
======================================
Box 393
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     You have failed me and the people
doomed to this world.
======================================
Box 394
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I'm so sorry\175 I didn't think of
it like this. They needed us!
======================================
Box 395
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     We can still do something right,
I mean, something to make up for our
failure.
======================================
Box 396
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Show us the source.
======================================
Box 397
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Yes, where is the source?
======================================
Box 398
--------------------------------------
     I am the source!
======================================
Box 399
--------------------------------------
     I am what you are looking for!
======================================
Box 400
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     But\175 why?
======================================
Box 401
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     I am surprised you outlived those
who entrusted you with their lives.
======================================
Box 402
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     It is a testament to your
training, or your cowardice in
putting your own life before those
of others.
======================================
Box 403
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     The way of the protector is
self-sacrifice.
======================================
Box 404
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Do not be dismayed. There is
suffering in life, and there are
defeats.
======================================
Box 405
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     It is completely natural. It is
the one true law of existence. No one
can avoid this.
======================================
Box 406
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     It builds character; it makes us
who we are. In suffering we are all
equal.
======================================
Box 407
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     No, that is beyond reasoning.
======================================
Box 408
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Isn't it? Reasoning can only
take us to certain places.
======================================
Box 409
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     But we've come so far, we have
accomplished so much just by getting
here\175
======================================
Box 410
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     You have forgotten your place in
the world.
======================================
Box 411
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Draw your weapons. There is one
thing left for me to teach you.
======================================
Box 412
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Please, no more\175
======================================
Box 413
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Feel what those you left behind
felt, embrace the pain and be
forgiven.
======================================
Box 414
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Please, no more{}
======================================
Box 415
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     They are all weaklings, Dogero
especially. You are not.
======================================

     You have passed my training.
======================================

     Hello Dogero.

--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I haven't even unlocked the full
potential of mine yet.
======================================

[\208 Manx]
     At the rate we're going, it won't
be long until you do.
======================================
Box 426
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     There is no turning back; we
must keep moving forward.
======================================
Box 427
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     No reason to go back, face-
forward.
======================================
Box 428
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Straight and steady, no time to
waste backtracking.
======================================
Box 429
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I am not going to run away, not
until I find what we are looking for.

     I am not going back there.

[\209 Innkeeper]
     I mean, in specific, you are\175
him. You're not quite what I imagined
him to be.
======================================
Box 433
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     It is an anonymously written
note requesting my immediate
assistance in a "Forest Pass south
of Fralin".
======================================
Box 434
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     The writer refers to me by name.
That and sent me this note the first
day I wandered into Fralin\175

     It is an anonymously written
note requesting my immediate
assistance in a "Forest Pass south

======================================

     The writer refers to me by name.
That and sent me this note the first
day I wandered into Fralin\175
======================================
Box 437
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Though the handwriting is
superb{}I have never seen anything so
perfectably written in my life!{}it's
just a note.
======================================
Box 438
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What is this? Hmm\175 the
handwriting looks a bit harsh, must
be something from before I joined up.
======================================
Box 439
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     What nonsense is this? Looks like
a love letter. It is addressed to
Dogero. Therefore it is none of my
business, thankfully.

     I just wanted to help.

--------------------------------------
[\225 ????]
     A wooden sword I made.
======================================
Box 444
--------------------------------------
[\225 ????]
     I wanted to help the community,
but the other kids laughed at me and
broke my sword.
======================================
Box 445
--------------------------------------
[\225 ????]
     I don't understand, I just wanted
to help them\175 and be a part of the
team.
======================================

     What's wrong, mister? You look
sad too.
======================================
Box 447
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     What is your name?
======================================
Box 448
--------------------------------------
[\225 ????]
     My name is\175 well, I prefer to be
called Mazing! I decided on it myself.
People pick on me because of that,
but I don't care\175 much.
======================================
Box 449
--------------------------------------
[\225 Mazing]
     You better avoid them, they like
to pick on new people too.
======================================
Box 450
--------------------------------------
[\225 Mazing]
     Ha, I thought I could make a
sword out of wood.
======================================
Box 451
--------------------------------------
[\225 Mazing]
     It may not have been of masterful
quality, but it was mine. I made it.
======================================
Box 452

[\225 Mazing]
     It is quite silly.
======================================
Box 453
--------------------------------------
[\225 Mazing]
     Well, it was nice meeting you.
======================================
Box 454
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     Wait, please\175
======================================
Box 455
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     Why didn't you ask for my name
in return?
======================================
Box 456
--------------------------------------
[\225 Mazing]
     Because it is yours{}yours to
offer, not mine.
======================================
Box 457
--------------------------------------
[\225 Mazing]
     I liked you enough to tell you
mine, but I won't force you to tell
me yours if you don't want to.
======================================

======================================

  Do you even know what that means?

Box 461
--------------------------------------
     So be it. Morning to night,
night to morning, the cycle will
repeat until you cannot.
======================================
Box 462
--------------------------------------
     Wait for it and see.
======================================
Box 463
--------------------------------------
     How much longer can you keep
this up? How much longer can you stay
in motion? How much longer can you go?
======================================
Box 464
--------------------------------------
     You have ${V27} days left of
will, of the drive to do or not to
do.
======================================
Box 465
--------------------------------------
     You will fade along with the
days until time runs dry along with
your soul.
======================================

     Do not lose all hope yet! You
still have ${V27} days left, and there
are ways to delay the inevitable fall.
======================================
Box 467
--------------------------------------
     Making the most out of a day
sets back the clock, but only a bit.
======================================

     Those who work toward their

like I said it would.

--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     Leave me alone.
======================================
Box 499
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     Why should we? Do you have
something to hide?
======================================
Box 500
--------------------------------------
[\204 ????]
     Stop it.
======================================
Box 501
--------------------------------------
[\221 ????]
     He looks like a monster to me{}
hey, look! He has a sword!
======================================
Box 502
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     Give it to me.
======================================
Box 503
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     Give it to me!
======================================
Box 504
--------------------------------------
[\204 ????]
     I'm leaving.
======================================
Box 505
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     I was just kidding around.
======================================
Box 506
--------------------------------------
[\204 ????]
     You hit him.
======================================
Box 507
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     We're going. You've shown him
his place well enough.
======================================
Box 508
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     Wait! We didn't say you could
leave!
======================================
Box 509
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     We've been expecting you.
======================================
Box 510
--------------------------------------
[\218 ????]
     Like a ghost you've come back to
haunt the area where you were killed.
You're as transparent as they come.
======================================
Box 511
--------------------------------------
[\218 ????]
     Everyone who runs comes back.
We all come back to work for him,
you're no different.
======================================
Box 512
--------------------------------------
[\218 ????]
     We are all the same, you and I.
======================================
Box 513
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     Who are you?
======================================
Box 514
--------------------------------------
[\218 ????]
     I am Lycant. Welcome home,
friend.
======================================
Box 515
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     Tell me, what did you think of
the Fralin locals?
======================================
Box 516
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     Some of them were friendly.
======================================
Box 517
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     They are deceivers; they don't
like us, they never have.
======================================
Box 518
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     We are the outcasts to them. We
don't belong in their world, even
though we have helped shape and make
it into what it is today.
======================================
Box 519
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     They condemn and insult us{}the
guardians and givers{}for keeping
them alive.
======================================
Box 520
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     Some of them were hostile.
======================================
Box 521
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     Yes, they are all monsters,
always have been.
======================================
Box 522
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     The irony, our job is to protect
monsters from monsters{}but not any
longer. We will crush them all.
======================================
Box 523
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     Did you not see how they mock us?
We sacrifice ourselves for these
people.
======================================
Box 524
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     I am tired of it, and so is he.
Now that you have returned, nothing
can stop us.
======================================
Box 525
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     Pathetic, he was right about you.
You really are beyond all hope.
======================================
Box 526
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Lycant!
======================================
Box 527
--------------------------------------
[\221 ????]
     See! I told you he was one of
them.
======================================
Box 528
--------------------------------------
[\204 ????]
     Shutup, birdbrain.
======================================
Box 529
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     Hey Lycant, why have you been
avoiding us? I thought you people
were supposed to be friendly.
======================================
Box 530
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     He's been avoiding us because
he's failed to get rid of the wolf
monster like he is supposed to.
======================================
Box 531
--------------------------------------
[\221 ????]
     He's a complete failure, that's
what he is!
======================================
Box 532
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     I'll suffer this no longer\175
======================================
Box 533
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     Take a look at them, a good hard
look.
======================================
Box 534
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     To them, we are the ones who do
not belong here.
======================================
Box 535
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     To them, we're the monsters.
======================================
Box 536
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     What is wrong with the
protectors, are there any left who
are doing their job?
======================================
Box 537
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     Lycant isn't doing anything but
hiding, and this one is already
leaving us.
======================================
Box 538
--------------------------------------
[\204 ????]
     It is just one wolf monster.
I have heard protectors take on far
more than that, and win.
======================================
Box 539
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     I am sick of them all. They only
do what's right in stories. Everyone
likes them because of stories.
======================================
Box 540
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     Stories are all they are. The
idea of a protector, a hero, comes
from stories, not from these cloaked
clowns.
======================================
Box 541
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     They are no better than monsters:
ignoring their duty to protect, hiding
outside of town, living outside of the
community doing whatever they please.
======================================
Box 542
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     It isn't right, and I am tired
of it.
======================================
Box 543
--------------------------------------
[\221 ????]
     Look at him, he thinks he's so
great.
======================================
Box 544
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     He's nothing.
======================================
Box 545
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     Please, leave me alone.
======================================
Box 546
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     Tell that to the monsters who
killed my parents!
======================================
Box 547
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     Don't turn around, look at him!
======================================
Box 548
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     You can't even defend yourself.
======================================
Box 549
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     You are right. I am no protector.
======================================
Box 550
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     Perhaps the cloak mislead you.
I no longer need it this far south.
======================================
Box 551
--------------------------------------
[\221 ????]
     Hey, that red headband\175
======================================
Box 552
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     You're\175
======================================
Box 553
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes, I am.
======================================
Box 554
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     You mean\175 you, the one in the
stories?
======================================
Box 555
--------------------------------------
[\204 ????]
     You're the best protector, aren't
you? Why don't you do something about
the monster?
======================================
Box 556
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Do you know how many monsters
there are in the world? Hundreds of
thousands\175
======================================
Box 557
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Fighting them would be like
cutting down every tree in this
forest. It can't be done. Believe
me, I've tried.
======================================
Box 558
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     To rid the world of monsters,
something like that would require the
collective effort of every man alive.
======================================
Box 559
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     And that will never happen.
======================================
Box 560
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I can't.
======================================
Box 561
--------------------------------------
[\204 ????]
     Why can't you try?
======================================
Box 562
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     Yeah, is there anything wrong
with trying?
======================================
Box 563
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I tried and failed. I can do no
better. People can't improve past
their limits\175
======================================
Box 564
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     And I found mine.
======================================
Box 565
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I should be dead, but by some
joke, I'm not. It makes no difference,
we'll all be worse than dead soon.
======================================
Box 566
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Now get out of here and enjoy
yourself before it is too late,
before Gahn comes.
======================================
Box 567
--------------------------------------
[\204 ????]
     \175Gahn?
======================================
Box 568
--------------------------------------
[\216 ????]
     You cannot be Dogero\175
======================================
Box 569
--------------------------------------
            ${V27} days left.
======================================
Box 570
--------------------------------------
        ${V27} days left of will.
======================================
Box 571
--------------------------------------
             ${V27} days left
          of wishful thinking.
======================================

--------------------------------------
        ${V27} days until the end.
======================================
Box 573
--------------------------------------
             ${V27} days until
         the end of the world.
======================================
Box 574
--------------------------------------
    ${V27} days until all is hopeless.
======================================
Box 575
--------------------------------------
            ${V27} days until
         complete abandonment.
======================================
Box 576
--------------------------------------
    ${V27} days until nothing matters.
======================================
Box 577
--------------------------------------
  ${V27} days until the clouds set in.
======================================
Box 578
--------------------------------------
             ${V27} days until
           all becomes gray.
======================================
Box 579
--------------------------------------
    ${V27} days before the inevitable.
======================================
Box 580
--------------------------------------
          ${V27} days remaining.
======================================
Box 581
--------------------------------------
     ${V27} days remain to fade away.
======================================
Box 582
--------------------------------------
            ${V27} days remain
          to feign interest.
======================================
Box 583
--------------------------------------
          ${V27} days to dream.
======================================
Box 584
--------------------------------------
          ${V27} days to waste.
======================================
Box 585
--------------------------------------
     ${V27} days to wander aimlessly.
======================================
Box 586
--------------------------------------
      ${V27} days to procrastinate.
======================================
Box 587
--------------------------------------
        ${V27} days to sleep away.
======================================
Box 588
--------------------------------------
       ${V27} days delay the fall.
======================================
Box 589
--------------------------------------
            ${V27} day remains.
======================================
Box 590
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I cannot go any farther.
======================================
Box 591
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Dogero! What are you doing?
Come on!
======================================
Box 592
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Don't give up!
======================================
Box 593
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     We cannot quit now, not in having
come so far\175
======================================
Box 594
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I can't do this anymore. I can't\175
======================================
Box 595
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     I feel so weary\175
======================================
Box 596
--------------------------------------
[\226 Wanderer]
     I should not have gotten up.
======================================
Box 597
--------------------------------------

     Right?
======================================
Box 598
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     It disgusts me.
======================================
Box 599
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Ah\175 yes, yes indeed.
======================================
Box 600
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What is it?
======================================
Box 601
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Judging from the markings left
on this pillar, someone with sharp
claws{}the likes of which a wolf
monster would have{}has passed here.
======================================
Box 602
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     So?
======================================
Box 603
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     So we will follow the pillars to
wherever they lead\175 and find whoever
wrote that note!
======================================
Box 604
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Are you sure?
======================================
Box 605
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Always.
======================================
Box 606
--------------------------------------
     Follow the pillars to find
the source.
======================================
Box 607
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We have no reason to enter Adlez,
at least not yet.
======================================
Box 608
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I have to find whoever wrote the
letter. She is in the Forest Pass,
not Adlez.
======================================
Box 609
--------------------------------------
     He is within the tomb, make
ready.
======================================
Box 610
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Huh?
======================================
Box 611
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What?
======================================
Box 612
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Nothing.
======================================
Box 613
--------------------------------------
          \169 Gained \137 Swift \169
======================================
Box 614
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What an ugly sword! I can
understand why someone left it to
rust in a box.
======================================
Box 615
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It looks fine to me, maybe even
better than the sword I'm using now.
======================================
Box 616
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I'm not surprised, the sword
you're using now is horrible!
======================================
Box 617
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Look at all the chips and nicks
on it. It looks so heavy and
unbalanced I'm amazed you are even
able to swing it around.
======================================
Box 618
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Then I'll use this new sword
from now on.
======================================
Box 619
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I wouldn't use that sword!
======================================
Box 620
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What about my old sword?
======================================
Box 621
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I wouldn't use that either! I'd
rather fight barehanded.
======================================
Box 622
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I'm using the new sword.
======================================
Box 623
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Suit yourself.
======================================
Box 624
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     This lock looks as if no ordinary
key would fit.
======================================
Box 625
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I've seen this type of lock
before, it is a blade lock.
======================================
Box 626
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     A what?
======================================
Box 627
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Strange locks, I know. It
requires a certain blade to unlock it.
======================================
Box 628
--------------------------------------
 \169 \137 Swift used to unlock the door \169
======================================
Box 629
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     My blade can't open it.
======================================
Box 630
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It won't open, we'll need to find
the right blade to unlock it.
======================================
Box 631
--------------------------------------
     Ready yourself, danger
approaches.
======================================
Box 632
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Did you hear that?
======================================
Box 633
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Hear what?
======================================
Box 634
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     A voice, it said we are in
danger.
======================================
Box 635
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Ha-ha, that's really funny, you
having voices in your head.
======================================
Box 636
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     But I'm being serious\175
======================================
Box 637
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Something is not right here.
======================================
Box 638
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Yeah, you aren't.
======================================
Box 639
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No, I have a strange feeling
about this room.
======================================
Box 640
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Dogero! That is the dumbest thing
I have ever heard! Are you some sort
of mystic who senses the aura of
things?
======================================
Box 641
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No, I{}
======================================
Box 642
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I cannot believe this! What, now
you're going to sense strangeness from
me because you think I am acting
childish?
======================================
Box 643
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Calm down, I said I had a strange
feeling because this room has a strong
scent, a plantlike one, and I don't
see any plants.
======================================
Box 644
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     So? It is damp in here, which
accounts for the moist smell; there
are roots hanging from the ceiling,
which account for the plantlike smell.
======================================
Box 645
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Maybe so, but what about that
mild scent, that strange one?
======================================
Box 646
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     My goodness, you are pathetic.
======================================
Box 647
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I am ten times better at picking
up scents than you and there is no
strange smell!
======================================
Box 648
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Don't even think about saying it.
======================================
Box 649
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Okay.
======================================
Box 650
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I did have a strange feeling
though.
======================================
Box 651
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh shutup.
======================================
Box 652
--------------------------------------
          \169 Gained \142 Prime \169
======================================
Box 653
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What a lovely blade! Lighter and
sharper than my needle\175
======================================
Box 654
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What is a sword like this doing
in a box? Why would anyone allow this
sword to go unused?
======================================
Box 655
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Maybe the wolf monster stole it
and hid it here.
======================================
Box 656
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     How foolish of him not to make
use of such a masterpiece! I am
insulted.
======================================
Box 657
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Are you finished?
======================================
Box 658
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Look! Look at it! It is so
beautiful.
======================================
Box 659
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Okay, I'm finished. Let's go!
======================================
Box 660
--------------------------------------
     An animal free, motions for
itself; an animal caged, motions for
you.
======================================
Box 661
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What was that?
======================================
Box 662
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What is what?
======================================
Box 663
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You didn't hear someone?
======================================
Box 664
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     This wasn't the first time, I
must be losing it.
======================================
Box 665
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Of course you're losing it,
you've been losing it for years.
Now's the time to change.
======================================
Box 666
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Get your act together and let's
go.
======================================
Box 667
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It's another blade lock.
======================================
Box 668
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It's another blade lock\175
======================================
Box 669
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Lycant, is that you?
======================================
Box 670
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     Why can't people ever leave me
alone?
======================================
Box 671
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     I'm not going to humor you fools,
not today, not any longer.
======================================
Box 672
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Something's not right here. He's
acting like a cornered animal.
======================================
Box 673
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I know. He looks somewhat skinny
though; we can take him if he's stupid
enough to fight us.
======================================
Box 674
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     Fools, I shall rip you to pieces.
======================================
Box 675
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     There's no reason for that; we're
not here to hurt you.
======================================
Box 676
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     We could have done this the easy
way but you wanted to be difficult.
======================================
Box 677
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     I hate it here, and it is all
your fault, you miserable dog\175 
======================================
Box 678
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     Gahn will deliver me from this
stick-hole once I kill you!
======================================
Box 679
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You can't be that senseless.
======================================
Box 680
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     Do not tell me what I can or
can't be! You aren't my master!
======================================
Box 681
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You sure aren't the master of
yourself.
======================================
Box 682
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Open your eyes. If you don't like
it here, then leave. So long as you
stay, it is your own fault, not mine.
======================================
Box 683
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You can leave this place anytime
you want, but instead you do what he
wants. You are carrying out his will,
which goes against your own.
======================================
Box 684
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     How can you continue to be a
protector knowing that?
======================================
Box 685
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     Huh. So that is why you won't
come back.
======================================
Box 686
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     An idealist who follows his own
ideals, they were not kidding about
you.
======================================
Box 687
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     Well, I have a little secret to
share with you.
======================================
Box 688
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     I enjoy nothing more than the
power the night gives me\175
======================================
Box 689
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     At his will, the night grants me
power, such power to terrorize the
fools above with for mistreating me\175
======================================
Box 690
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     Behold!
======================================
Box 691
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     Don't kill me! Spare me my
miserable life, death is too kind a
punishment for one who's done what
I've done.
======================================
Box 692
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What a coward!
======================================
Box 693
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     Please, if you spare me I will
never harm another creature for as
long as I live! I will protect Fralin!
Save lives whenever I can!
======================================
Box 694
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Don't listen to him, Dogero. He's
speaking nonsense.
======================================
Box 695
--------------------------------------
======================================
Box 696
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     Oh, oh! Thank you, thank{}
======================================
Box 697
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Why did you hesitate?
======================================
Box 698
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I don't know\175 it has been awhile
since I've been in situations like
this.
======================================
Box 699
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It would have been immoral to
forgive him. You know what he's
responsible for{}he tried to kill us!
======================================
Box 700
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     He knew what he was doing. If he
were truly sorry, he wouldn't have
done what he did in the first place.
======================================
Box 701
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     He could have changed.
======================================
Box 702
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It doesn't matter what he could
have done, it matters what he did.
Actions do not lie, they just are,
and his actions made him a monster.
======================================
Box 703
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Choices have consequences, and
he chose poorly.
======================================
Box 704
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I know, I won't lose any sleep
knowing he's dead.
======================================
Box 705
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Good.
======================================
Box 706
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What are you doing!
======================================
Box 707
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Listen carefully Lycant, you are
free to live under one condition: you
make good on everything you promised
me while begging for your life.
======================================
Box 708
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     I will, I assure you I will
change my ways. I admit I have been
senseless, I hate Gahn and he has been
using me\175
======================================
Box 709
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     He was able to force me into this
situation due to my own cowardice.
I will no longer be his slave.
======================================
Box 710
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     Thank you, because of you I now
have a second chance in life. You will
not be disappointed.
======================================
Box 711
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Unbelievable! What were you
thinking?
======================================
Box 712
--------------------------------------
[\225 ????]
     Greetings.
======================================
Box 713
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     I'm sorry, who is that
accompanying you?
======================================
Box 714
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     This is Mi'la, a childhood friend
who found me in the Forest Pass.
======================================
Box 715
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     I am not familiar with her. She
must be a selfless hero like yourself
for aiding you in defeating Lycant.
======================================
Box 716
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     Where is she going?
======================================
Box 717
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You just insulted her. I think.
======================================
Box 718
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     Oh! I am truly sorry, I didn't
mean to be so rude with whatever I
said. Please give her my apologies.
======================================
Box 719
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Okay.
======================================
Box 720
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     I must be more careful with my
words, I do not mean to anger. I am
deeply thankful to you for rescuing
me from Lycant.
======================================
Box 721
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I didn't even know he had you
captive.
======================================
Box 722
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     He has had me captive ever since
he came to Fralin to be their
protector. I do not know why.
======================================
Box 723
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     I do know the monsters have
returned to these lands, just like
before, even after you and the others
destroyed the source.
======================================
Box 724
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     You look troubled.
======================================
Box 725
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     The monsters have never left\175
======================================
Box 726
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We were not able to defeat the
source.
======================================
Box 727
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     Then the situation is worse than
I thought.
======================================
Box 728
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     Something seeks to return the
land into the ruins from which it
rose, and you have been proven
powerless to stop it.
======================================
Box 729
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     I fear there is nothing we can
do.
======================================
Box 730
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I used to think it was possible
to change things for the better, but
I don't see it happening anymore.
It is hopeless.
======================================
Box 731
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I had given up until recently.
Mi'la persuaded me it was better to
do something rather than nothing. But
in the end it doesn't matter.
======================================
Box 732
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     None of this matters, we can't
win.
======================================
Box 733
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I can't tell her that.
======================================
Box 734
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     Then do not. Her spirit is bright
because she lacks your experience.
It will fade with time, as do all
things.
======================================
Box 735
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     Our only chance is to find my
three companions, the valorians:
Gitleh, Fedora, and Shoda.
======================================
Box 736
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     We were able to defeat Grinlow
once before; we should be able to
defeat this new evil.
======================================
Box 737
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     The closest valorian is Gitleh,
to the south in Adlez. United as one,
we may have a chance.
======================================
Box 738
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     I am far too weak to be of much
help by myself. I will accompany you
and help however I can, no matter how
humble my help may be.
======================================
Box 739
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     My soul rests in your hands.

======================================
Box 744
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I'm glad you're still alive.
======================================
Box 745
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Then why did you leave me to die?
======================================
Box 746
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Oh, get over it.

[\200 Dogero]
     Have you come to finish the job?
======================================
Box 748
--------------------------------------

     I'm not here to kill you, fool.
I just want to talk.
======================================
Box 749
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I have nothing to say to you.
======================================
Box 750
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Running away from problems only
makes it worse. At least I am doing
something. You've given up.
======================================
Box 751
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I have not given up. I only see
the situation as hopeless.
======================================
Box 752
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Same thing.
======================================
Box 753
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     The protectors work for him now,
or they do not work at all.
======================================
Box 754
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Lycant's defeat is meaningless
in the larger picture. There are many
like him out there, some stronger,
some weaker.
======================================
Box 755
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     There's quite a few of them in
Adlez, if that's where you are headed
next. They are mostly of the stronger
type.
======================================
Box 756
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     This was a one-man operation.
Imagine what a larger force could do
with just one town.
======================================
Box 757
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Why are you telling me this?
======================================
Box 758
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Don't be a hero. That is all I
am saying.
======================================
Box 759
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     You should get out of here before
he comes. He knew you would come back.

======================================
Box 763
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Kind of, she turned into this
icon.
======================================
Box 764
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Good, I couldn't stand the sight
of her.
======================================
Box 765

     Why?
======================================

--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It's beyond you, sloth-ero.
======================================
Box 767
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     She suggested we find the other
valorians. They might be able to
defeat Gahn.
======================================
Box 768
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We don't need them.
======================================
Box 769
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It wouldn't hurt to find the
others, she said Gitleh is in Adlez
to the south of here.
======================================

[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh, alright, we'll have to travel
to Adlez together then.

     I do not like having another's
life in my hands.
======================================

     Oh, come on! She's just a silly
icon.
======================================

--------------------------------------
     Do you understand the nature
of combat?
======================================
Box 1031
--------------------------------------
     So be it. Prepare yourself for
battle.
======================================
Box 1032
--------------------------------------
     You have four means of action in
battle: attack, skill, defend, and
item.
======================================
Box 1033
--------------------------------------
     Attack to use your \187Strength to
damage an opponent.
======================================
Box 1034
--------------------------------------
     Your skills are your special
attacks. They require \132SP.
======================================
Box 1035
--------------------------------------
     After battles, your \132SP is
replenished. Do not be afraid to make
use of all your \132SP in every battle.
======================================
Box 1036
--------------------------------------
     There are four types of skills:
\178 damage \133HP, \179 damage other,
\181 improve ally, and \182 improve self.
======================================
Box 1037
--------------------------------------
     The bonus from improving an ally
will cost something additional to \132SP.
======================================
Box 1038
--------------------------------------
     Defend to protect yourself from
attack.
======================================
Box 1039
--------------------------------------
     Some items can be used in battle.
======================================
Box 1040
--------------------------------------
     You have items \163 HP and \160 Up in
your pack. Use \163 HP to regain health.
Use \160 Up on an ally too weary to
continue fighting.
======================================
Box 1041
--------------------------------------
     There is one last basic element
to battles: \170Gain.
======================================
Box 1042
--------------------------------------
     Every attack, besides those used
on allies, has a parallel bonus to
the attacker. The attacker's \170Gain
determines the extent of the bonus.
======================================
Box 1043
--------------------------------------
     Executing a normal attack raises
your \132SP by your \170Gain. This can
raise your \132SP over your maximum.
Defending sets your \132SP to maximum.
======================================
Box 1044
--------------------------------------
     I have explained the basic
elements of combat. The advanced
elements are left for you to figure
out.
======================================
Box 1045
--------------------------------------
     Know that some battles cannot be
won. You will understand, soon.

everyone here does, all the time. It
is so very stressful.

where is he?
======================================

they all listen to him and completely
ignore me. It makes me sick.

he is{}I can solve problems too! But
everyone goes to him with their
problems, not me.

Box 1160
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Let's go back to my house.
======================================
Box 1161
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Okay, I have an idea on how to{}
======================================
Box 1162
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     How can we trust him? He lives in
the east side!
======================================
Box 1163
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     So what? He's still smarter than
you'll ever be!
======================================
Box 1164
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     How dare you!
======================================
Box 1165
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Well, there they go. This is
hopeless.
======================================
Box 1166
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Stop!
======================================
Box 1167
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Quiet, all of you! Come with me
and we will settle whatever petty
differences you are fighting about
in a civilized manner.
======================================
Box 1168
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Who was that?
======================================
Box 1169
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     That was the big know-it-all
mayor, who thinks he knows what's
best for everyone.
======================================
Box 1170
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     That's nice. Me and Dogero have
to go now, see you later.
======================================
Box 1171
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Can I tag along, please?
======================================
Box 1172
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No, you{}
======================================
Box 1173
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Sure you can.
======================================
Box 1174
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Thanks!
======================================
Box 1175
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No!
======================================
Box 1176
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We can use your help in solving
this strange problem in Adlez.
======================================
Box 1177
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No.
======================================
Box 1178
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's go!
======================================
Box 1179
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Fine, fine.
======================================
Box 1180
--------------------------------------
     \169 \202 Johan joins the party \169
======================================
Box 1181
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Be quiet and wait here, I am
going to\175 check something.
======================================
Box 1182
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Check what?
======================================
Box 1183
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I have to make sure he's not
around, cause if he is, we're out of
here.
======================================
Box 1184
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Who are you talking about?
======================================
Box 1185
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Tell you after I peek.
======================================
Box 1186
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What the\175
======================================
Box 1187
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Uh, something is not right here.
They\175 the two groups, well, this is
not good, they uh, it looked like they
had\175 and the mayor{}
======================================
Box 1188
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Stop babbling and spit it out!
======================================
Box 1189
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Those two groups drew weapons and
made the mayor follow them into the
back.
======================================
Box 1190
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's go.
======================================
Box 1191
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     No!
======================================
Box 1192
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Well, uh, I mean the mayor is\175
we shouldn't go in there and\175 he can
take care of himself{}
======================================
Box 1193
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Quit mumbling and speak up! The
mayor is in trouble, right? Is he
worth saving or not?
======================================
Box 1194
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yes, he is.
======================================
Box 1195
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Then let's go!
======================================
Box 1196
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     By order of his mayor, no one is
allowed entrance.
======================================
Box 1197
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     This is an emergency!
======================================
Box 1198
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     That is too bad, his mayor of
Adlez has told me to withhold entrance
regardless of reason.
======================================
Box 1199
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You have to be kidding me\175
======================================
Box 1200
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Come on, let's leave.
======================================
Box 1201
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I have a plan. Let's sneak
inside; that guard can't stay awake
all day.
======================================
Box 1202
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Why waste time? I say we rush the
guard now, they might rotate guard
duty.
======================================
Box 1203
--------------------------------------
======================================
Box 1204
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We don't have time to wait, let's
find out what happened to the mayor.
======================================
Box 1205
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     I do say, what do you think
you're{}
======================================
Box 1206
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh shutup and fight.
======================================
Box 1207
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Is he still alive?
======================================
Box 1208
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I'm not sure.
======================================
Box 1209
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Don't worry about him{}you're
okay, right champ?
======================================
Box 1210
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     Ooo\175 ow\175
======================================
Box 1211
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     See? He's even better than
before! Let's find the mayor.
======================================
Box 1212
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Is she always like that?
======================================
Box 1213
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We'll wait, we don't want to draw
attention to ourselves.
======================================
Box 1214
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     That's impossible; you're a
famous hero, I'm this town's
protector, and Mi'la is, uh\175
======================================
Box 1215
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Is what? Beautiful? I know, but
I don't care for the attention.
======================================
Box 1216
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Don't worry. With your beauty,
attracting attention won't be a
problem.
======================================
Box 1217
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Dogero! Do you see how he treats
me? Me! Tell that rude little dwarf
to run along and play with his fellow
children.
======================================
Box 1218
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Look, I'm sorry, I\175
======================================
Box 1219
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     The people here, the people my
age are horrible. I'd much rather
stay with you two.
======================================
Box 1220
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Well, the people here are stupid,
and you do seem to have been affected
by their stupidity, but me and Dogero
are a team of two.
======================================
Box 1221
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Please, don't leave me here
alone\175
======================================
Box 1222
--------------------------------------
======================================
Box 1223
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You can't stay with us, it is too
dangerous. You don't even know what
we are looking for.
======================================
Box 1224
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Then tell me what you seek so
I'll know. Is it something you've
lost?
======================================
Box 1225
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You don't know what you're
looking for?
======================================
Box 1226
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I couldn't do it, you don't have
a chance, no one does. I appreciate
your help, but you're just a pup. I
think it best if you leave us.
======================================
Box 1227
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Fine.
======================================
Box 1228
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I've found what I have been
looking for and it's sending me away.
But I'm just a pup, so what do I know.
======================================
Box 1229
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You are such a fool.
======================================
Box 1230
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Didn't you want him to leave?
======================================
Box 1231
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I'm not talking about that.
Perhaps you'll figure out why sometime
soon if we keep to our quests.
======================================
Box 1232
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We have more than one?
======================================
Box 1233
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Will you always be so hopeless?
======================================
Box 1234
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You're dodging my question with
a question again.
======================================
Box 1235
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Let's go.
======================================
Box 1236
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You can stay as long as you wish.
Just know that we are looking for
Gitleh's icon here to defeat an
undefeatable monster.
======================================
Box 1237
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     If you value your life, leave.
======================================
Box 1238
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Ha! That's the reason why I'm
not going to.
======================================
Box 1239
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Ugh, I can't stand this.
======================================
Box 1240
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Listen carefully doggy dearest,
either he stays or I do but not both.
He'll just get in the way.
======================================
Box 1241
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Nope, both of you are staying.
======================================
Box 1242
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Perhaps your sloth-like brain
hasn't grasped what I've said yet.
======================================
Box 1243
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Nope, I understand.
======================================
Box 1244
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Fine then! Forget you two losers,
you are nothing without me!
======================================
Box 1245
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Mi'la{}
======================================
Box 1246
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Don't Mi'la me! You're so rude;
this is what I get for helping you?
You don't deserve me!
======================================
Box 1247
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I hope you die.
======================================
Box 1248
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Whoa\175 I thought she only hated
me, not you too.
======================================
Box 1249
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Well?
======================================
Box 1250
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We sneak in later when the guard
is asleep\175
======================================
Box 1251
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Without Mi'la.
======================================
Box 1252
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Is that all of them?
======================================
Box 1253
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     There might be more hiding.
======================================
Box 1254
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Thanks for saving me. I could
have managed if they hadn't caught
me by surprise\175
======================================
Box 1255
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Wasn't Johan with you before?
======================================
Box 1256
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     He was; he left after we found
out you were in trouble. I didn't
want him to get hurt.
======================================
Box 1257
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     He ran away knowing I was in
trouble? Rotten pup.
======================================
Box 1258
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No, he wanted to stay with us
and save you, but I wouldn't let him.
======================================
Box 1259
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Figures, he's an annoying little
brat who doesn't know what's good for
him.
======================================
Box 1260
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     He needs to understand what it
means to be responsible: knowing your
duty and sticking to it.
======================================
Box 1261
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     I put the people of this town
before myself. It's his duty to do
the same, the people come to him often
enough with their problems.
======================================
Box 1262
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     That's horrible, no wonder he
wanted to stay with us.
======================================
Box 1263
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     He should have done whatever it
is that he didn't do, that's always
his problem.
======================================
Box 1264
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You're not making any sense. Why
are you so interested in him?
======================================
Box 1265
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Forget him, my town is in
trouble, and you must save it. I
believe the source of the problem
is somewhere in these mines.
======================================
Box 1266
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     The source of the problem is
here, with you.
======================================
Box 1267
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Yes, that's what I just said.
Most of them are invisible, you'll
need a glass thing I saw them use to
see them.
======================================
Box 1268
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Looks like we shattered all their
glasses in the fight.
======================================
Box 1269
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's check that guard at the
front of the house, he might have one.
======================================
Box 1270
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     You! What are you doing here?
======================================
Box 1271
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Hi, nice to see you too.
======================================
Box 1272
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Who is that?
======================================
Box 1273
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Just someone I tricked into
letting me tie up{}
======================================
Box 1274
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     A trick I learned from the master
of making people do what's best for
others and not themselves: you.
======================================
Box 1275
--------------------------------------
[\224 Guard]
     I'll do anything you want, please
don't kill me!
======================================
Box 1276
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What a bore. See if he has a
glass thing on him, we need it to
see through their illusions.
======================================
Box 1277
--------------------------------------
[\224 Guard]
     Take it! It's in my pocket.
======================================
Box 1278
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Strange little device. Let me
integrate it into my glasses.
======================================
Box 1279
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     There, finished.
======================================
Box 1280
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's explore the mine.
======================================
Box 1281
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Does that mean I can tag along?
======================================
Box 1282
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes, but only if you want to.
======================================
Box 1283
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Excellent, let's go!
======================================
Box 1284
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Where do you think you're going?
Keep an eye on our pal there while
we are gone.
======================================
Box 1285
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     But, I'm the mayor! It's my duty
to help.
======================================
Box 1286
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     No good adventurers, I'm the
mayor and they aren't. Can't tell me
what to do, I'm supposed to tell them
what to do\175
======================================
Box 1287
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Are you okay?
======================================
Box 1288
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Of course I am okay. What of you,
boy, are you okay?
======================================
Box 1289
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Of course I am okay.
======================================
Box 1290
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Could have fooled me.
======================================
Box 1291
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Too easy to fool you, you're
lucky I saved you.
======================================
Box 1292
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Took you long enough, I've seen
slime fight better than that.
======================================
Box 1293
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Gee, you're welcome.
======================================
Box 1294
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Don't use that tone with me,
have you forgotten who you are talking
to?
======================================
Box 1295
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Nope, I'm talking to a halfwit.
======================================
Box 1296
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Don't get snippy with me, I'll
tan your hide!
======================================
Box 1297
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Do your worst, that's all you
ever do.
======================================
Box 1298
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     You no good disgraceful pup!
======================================
Box 1299
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Stop! We have real enemies to
fight, not each other.
======================================
Box 1300
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     You are right, my apologies.
======================================
Box 1301
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     I don't know where they came
from, but I'm certain this mine is
their base. They've been messing with
my town right under my nose.
======================================
Box 1302
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Your town?
======================================
Box 1303
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Yes, my town. The bastards are
everywhere in disguise, making people
fight each other over the dumbest
things.
======================================
Box 1304
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I've noticed.
======================================
Box 1305
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     The rest of them are invisible.
I think they use some glass device to
see each other.
======================================
Box 1306
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Uh, I see what you're talking
about, but I can't find one that is
not broken.
======================================
Box 1307
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Why don't you fix one?
======================================
Box 1308
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I don't know how.
======================================
Box 1309
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Genius-boy can't fix one? That's
too bad.
======================================
Box 1310
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What about the guard outside the
house? He might have one.
======================================
Box 1311
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I'll check.
======================================
Box 1312
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Gahn willing, Adlez will be saved
from whatever is down here.
======================================
Box 1313
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No\175
======================================
Box 1314
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     No? These are troubled times, it
will take a miracle to get my town
back into shape. Gahn is on our side,
I know he is.
======================================
Box 1315
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Then we've already lost.
======================================
Box 1316
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No good, his was broken too.
======================================
Box 1317
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We'll have to find someone who
has one then.
======================================
Box 1318
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Good luck, I know you can do it.
======================================
Box 1319
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Then don't tell us good luck.
======================================
Box 1320
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     You'll need it with Johan around.
I have faith in you; Adlez will be
in your debt.
======================================
Box 1321
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Adlez is always in some sort of
debt.
======================================
Box 1322
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     You know damn well what I mean.
======================================
Box 1323
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Too bad you don't.
======================================
Box 1324
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We're wasting time, let's go.
======================================
Box 1325
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh, hello. Looks like you two
are still alive.
======================================
Box 1326
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Mi'la{}
======================================
Box 1327
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I couldn't help myself! The guard
was so rude, you remember! So I gave
him a little spank and tied him up.
======================================
Box 1328
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Ha-ha-ha, I didn't know you were
into that!
======================================
Box 1329
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     I take it you know her{}
======================================
Box 1330
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Into what?
======================================
Box 1331
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Uh-oh! I've been a naughty boy!
Be gentle!
======================================
Box 1332
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Ow! Hey, I was joking!
======================================
Box 1333
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Quit playing around and see if he
has one that's not broken.
======================================
Box 1334
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Has what?
======================================
Box 1335
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     A glass to dispel illusions, fair
lady, may I ask who you are?
======================================
Box 1336
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No.
======================================
Box 1337
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     No reason to be sassy to the
mayor of Adlez.
======================================
Box 1338
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Shutup old man.
======================================
Box 1339
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Ha-ha-ha!
======================================
Box 1340
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     How dare you!
======================================
Box 1341
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Find it yet?
======================================
Box 1342
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yeah, let me integrate it into
my glasses.
======================================
Box 1343
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's explore the mine.
======================================
Box 1344
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Coming Mi'la?
======================================
Box 1345
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     May as well.
======================================
Box 1346
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Hey mayor! Keep an eye on him
while we're gone.
======================================
Box 1347
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Wait! Come back!
======================================
Box 1348
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Shh, someone's coming.
======================================
Box 1349
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     You cannot defeat what you
cannot see. Kill them!
======================================
Box 1350
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I found a glass piece, I'll
integrate it into my glasses.
======================================
Box 1351
--------------------------------------
     \169 Johan learns \189 TrueSight \169
======================================
Box 1352
--------------------------------------
     Use \189 TrueSight in battle to
see the unseen.
======================================
Box 1353
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     There, now we should be able to
see them.
======================================
Box 1354
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     Oh, hello Dogero. I see you've
met my brother.
======================================
Box 1355
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What are you doing down here?
======================================
Box 1356
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     What do you care? I'm not down
here for you, I came down here for
him.
======================================
Box 1357
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     Listen to me, you should turn
back, it is really dangerous down
there. The mines are unstable and
dark, and I have seen monsters\175
======================================
Box 1358
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Don't worry yourself dear, we're
not afraid of the dark.
======================================
Box 1359
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Uh, monsters? In the dark? I
think we should maybe turn back.
======================================
Box 1360
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     Yes, there is no reason to be
down here when the people need you
up there. They depend on you, you
know.
======================================
Box 1361
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     Fighting monsters does not solve
anything. You can't kill them all,
can you?
======================================
Box 1362
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Well, we can try.
======================================
Box 1363
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Come on, let's go.
======================================
Box 1364
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     You don't have to listen to me,
no one really does. I just wanted to
warn you.
======================================
Box 1365
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     Turn back. You can do more good
up there than down here. The people
need you.
======================================
Box 1366
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     Hello, I am glad to see no one
is dead yet.
======================================
Box 1367
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It's you again.
======================================
Box 1368
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     I just came to remind you that
it is very dangerous down here. You
should get out while you still can.
======================================
Box 1369
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Why should we?
======================================
Box 1370
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     I'm trying to be nice, Johan.
======================================
Box 1371
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We've come this far, no point in
turning back now.
======================================
Box 1372
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     I don't want to see anyone hurt.
Bad things live down here.
======================================
Box 1373
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     Very bad things.
======================================
Box 1374
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I'd expect that much.
======================================
Box 1375
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     You don't understand. Please,
turn back.
======================================
Box 1376
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You don't have to worry about us,
we can take care of ourselves. I am a
trained swordsman; bad things are
nothing new to me.
======================================
Box 1377
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     Dogero, you have to listen to me.
They want to kill you\175
======================================
Box 1378
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     Bad things are down here. Please,
turn back.
======================================
Box 1379
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Dangle! Leave us alone.
======================================
Box 1380
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     Please\175
======================================
Box 1381
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What are you doing down here if
it is so dangerous?
======================================
Box 1382
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     Well, uh\175
======================================
Box 1383
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     How did you even get here?
======================================
Box 1384
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     I've been exploring these mines
my whole life. They're mostly empty,
and no one really notices me to begin
with. I spend a lot of time here.
======================================
Box 1385
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You have to stop acting like
this. You're too nice to people.
======================================
Box 1386
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Stop acting on everyone else's
behalf and stick up for your own! You
know why you're so miserable.
======================================
Box 1387
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     I know the answers to my
questions, I just won't accept them.
======================================
Box 1388
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     That is horrible. Why won't you?
======================================
Box 1389
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     All right\175 if you really want to
keep going, you'd better take that
turn. The path behind me is a dead-
end.
======================================
Box 1390
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     I hope you find what you are
looking for.
======================================
Box 1391
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     This path dead-ends, you need to
take the other one.
======================================
Box 1392
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     Are you even listening to me?
======================================
Box 1393
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     I am such a failure\175
======================================
Box 1394
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What did you fail at?
======================================
Box 1395
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     I\175
======================================
Box 1396
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Spit it out! You're just like
your brother.
======================================
Box 1397
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Hey!
======================================
Box 1398
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     They\175 wanted me to stop you.
======================================
Box 1399
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Who are they?
======================================
Box 1400
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     They don't want you down here,
and when they realized you weren't
turning back, they set up a trap.
======================================
Box 1401
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     I was supposed to lead you to it,
but I\175
======================================
Box 1402
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     I'm so tired; tired of being
forgotten, used, stressed\175
======================================
Box 1403
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You said that you know the
answers. You do not have to accept
this nonsense.
======================================
Box 1404
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     I want to cry\175 I'm so easily
erased, and there is nothing I can do
about it.
======================================
Box 1405
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     I feel so worn out and jaded,
I just want to cry\175
======================================
Box 1406
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Disgusting.
======================================
Box 1407
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You don't have to be so harsh.
======================================
Box 1408
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     She has accepted her failures.
There's no reason for us to stick
around and cry about it, let's keep
moving forward.
======================================
Box 1409
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Dangle\175 I have never forgotten
you. Please, don't do this to
yourself.
======================================
Box 1410
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Is this really who you are?
======================================
Box 1411
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     I don't know\175
======================================
Box 1412
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Don't allow others to make you
feel so bad.
======================================
Box 1413
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     That's easy for you to say,
everyone likes you.
======================================
Box 1414
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     No they don't, they don't even
listen to me most of the time.
======================================
Box 1415
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Dogero and Mi'la are different,
I haven't even been around them for
very long{}
======================================
Box 1416
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     And look how far I have come with
them, all the way down here to the
source of the problem in Adlez.
======================================
Box 1417
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     There's something so different
about them, in comparison to everyone
else here.
======================================
Box 1418
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     They have this sense of life\175
it is difficult for me to explain.
======================================
Box 1419
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Dangle, do you want to come with
me?
======================================
Box 1420
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     You know I'm not good at
fighting, but\175
======================================
Box 1421
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     Thank you for asking.
======================================
Box 1422
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     You should hurry and catch up
with them and tell them\175 tell them
that I'm sorry.
======================================
Box 1423
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Consider it done.
======================================
Box 1424
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What took you so long?
======================================
Box 1425
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Dangle wanted me to tell you that
she is sorry.
======================================
Box 1426
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     And?
======================================
Box 1427
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     And what?
======================================
Box 1428
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What is she sorry about?
======================================
Box 1429
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You know.
======================================
Box 1430
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No I don't, you have to tell me.
======================================
Box 1431
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You know very well what she is
sorry about.
======================================
Box 1432
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     And that would be? I won't know
until you say it.
======================================
Box 1433
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Quit it, Mi'la.
======================================
Box 1434
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     This looks like the site of
Gitleh's tomb. His icon should be in
here somewhere.
======================================
Box 1435
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's find it.
======================================
Box 1436
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     They didn't put up much of a
fight, I was expecting to break a
sweat.
======================================
Box 1437
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Never expect anything, or else
you'll always end up disappointed.
======================================
Box 1438
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Gahn's plan worked. The people
of this town were crippled before we
even got here.
======================================
Box 1439
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     We will need to bring the lead
protectors up to speed and mobilize
some troops to take to Adlez.
======================================
Box 1440
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     It should be like this place
before we get there.
======================================
Box 1441
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     We don't need an army of these\175
people, if you can still call them
that.
======================================
Box 1442
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     They are weak, but there is
strength in their weakness.
======================================
Box 1443
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Like what?
======================================
Box 1444
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     They are willing to serve us,
for one.
======================================
Box 1445
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     That's it?
======================================
Box 1446
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     The strong serve the weak, and
the weak serve the strong. That is
the new order.
======================================
Box 1447
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Gahn can articulate the reasons
better than I can. My job is to be
the hand, not the brain.
======================================
Box 1448
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Watch this.
======================================
Box 1449
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Stand up.
======================================
Box 1450
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I am thirsty. Get me a glass of
water.
======================================
Box 1451
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Protector's never had that kind
of respect before Gahn.
======================================
Box 1452
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     That kind of respect is the kind
a slave has to a master.
======================================
Box 1453
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     No, it is the kind the weak
should have for their protectors.
======================================
Box 1454
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     You've changed.
======================================
Box 1455
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     So have you.
======================================
Box 1456
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Let's hurry up and finish this.
======================================
Box 1457
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     I can't pick one! They all have
their good and bad points, all shades
of gray.
======================================
Box 1458
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What are you doing?
======================================
Box 1459
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     I'm picking a stud, that's what
I'm doing! Strong baby beasts don't
come from thin air, you know.
======================================
Box 1460
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     That's disgusting!
======================================
Box 1461
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Revolting. It would take a
monster to want to breed more.
======================================
Box 1462
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     How rude! This is an art, they
laugh at me for taking this so
seriously, they don't understand.
Neither do you!
======================================
Box 1463
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     My beauties, yes you are\175
show them your good breeding, rip
them apart!
======================================
Box 1464
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I'd pick that one, the small one.
======================================
Box 1465
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     You what! Are you out of your
mind? You don't understand! No one
does!
======================================
Box 1466
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     That one is too weak and
independent. I need a strong stud to
perfect the lineage of my beauties.
======================================
Box 1467
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     I know! Whoever kills you will
be my stud{}sic them!
======================================
Box 1468
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     No one will find you, my sweet
darling. Don't worry, only I shall
grace the delicate curves of your
slippery skin\175
======================================
Box 1469
--------------------------------------
======================================
Box 1470
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Who are you talking to?
======================================
Box 1471
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Ack, intruders! What did you see?
Tell me! What did you see?
======================================
Box 1472
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What are you talking about? Did
I miss something?
======================================
Box 1473
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Good, you can't touch her, she's
mine! Back off! No, I'll kill you
just in case.
======================================
Box 1474
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     We saw, or heard, more than we
would have liked. You're really sick.
======================================
Box 1475
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     You can't fool me, we're all
sick at heart! You'd be just like me
if you ever had her in your
fingertips.
======================================
Box 1476
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Your eyes touching me like grubby
little children, you're the ones who
are sick! Heart of darkness{}you can
not have her!
======================================
Box 1477
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     And on the fourth day the tears
of illusion fell down from Gahn,
unshackling his mind.
======================================
Box 1478
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What are you doing?
======================================
Box 1479
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Fool! You've interrupted our
ritual of passing, this poor creature
won't make the transition.
======================================
Box 1480
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Transition into what?
======================================
Box 1481
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     A holy sentinel of Gahn! This
man's self-sacrifice\175 come brothers!
We won't let it be in vain!
======================================
Box 1482
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Monsters! Either way that is a
transition into death, and for that,
you die.
======================================
Box 1483
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Whoa, uh, please excuse her,
sometimes she's{}
======================================
Box 1484
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Shutup and kill them! Let them
embrace their holy death!
======================================
Box 1485
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Come brothers, we must call upon
the sentinel to defeat them{}commence
the ritual of heretic bane!
======================================
Box 1486
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What are tears of illusion?
======================================
Box 1487
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     The tears of illusion Gahn felt
upon discovering things hidden beyond
reality, haven't you ever read the
Word?
======================================
Box 1488
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Sacrilege! We can't complete the
ritual now.
======================================
Box 1489
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     They mean us harm!
======================================
Box 1490
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Summon Gahn's sentinel, it will
protect us.
======================================
Box 1491
--------------------------------------
[\207 ????]
     Well, well, well, if it isn't
you. I wasn't expecting you to show
up, well\175 ever!
======================================
Box 1492
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Who are you?
======================================
Box 1493
--------------------------------------
[\207 ????]
     So hungry for enlightenment, you
are. You have the one time only
privilege of speaking to me, Talvas,
champion of truth and related baloney.
======================================
Box 1494
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Baloney sounds good, I'm
starving.
======================================
Box 1495
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     Silence! You do not know, know
nothing of what is to be.
======================================
Box 1496
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     I come by edict of Gahn to bring
truth and decay to this town of
production and resource.
======================================
Box 1497
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     When profit lays its golden egg,
only decadence can hatch, it is only
natural; the scale of society and
fabrication balances itself.
======================================
Box 1498
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     I have lovely things planned for
Adlez, lovely filth that it is, you'll
adore it.
======================================
Box 1499
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You're the cause for the trouble
in Adlez?
======================================
Box 1500
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     So na\250ve! Untaught you are.
Adlez is the cause for the trouble
in Adlez.
======================================
Box 1501
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     Rampant avarice brings its own
swift destruction, and I, my dear boy,
I am but a part of the blind night
that follows every setting sun.
======================================
Box 1502
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You can't be real.
======================================
Box 1503
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     Well nothing ever is, Dogero,
glad you're catching on.
======================================
Box 1504
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     Hellbound!
======================================
Box 1505
--------------------------------------
[\205 Hellbound]
     SRAAA!
======================================
Box 1506
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     Make them scream.
======================================
Box 1507
--------------------------------------
[\205 Hellbound]
     GRAAAH!
======================================
Box 1508
--------------------------------------
[\205 Hellbound]
     RAA!
======================================
Box 1509
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     Impossible.
======================================
Box 1510
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Jump down here and I will show
you just how impossible.
======================================
Box 1511
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     Don't think you have a chance,
because you don't. Next time will be
different.
======================================
Box 1512
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yeah, next time Dogero will kill
you.
======================================
Box 1513
--------------------------------------
[\206 ????]
     I look forward to our next
meeting.
======================================
Box 1514
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     Come Rift, now is not the time.
======================================
Box 1515
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     Soon.
======================================
Box 1516
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     Greetings. I have longed for the
coming moments.
======================================
Box 1517
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Something's not right. Look at
his eyes\175
======================================
Box 1518
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     He's hiding something.
======================================
Box 1519
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     Only those that see worry about
hiding. My eyes, blind. My other
senses, beyond sight.
======================================
Box 1520
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     Behold, the black blade Vonnegut,
laughing prophet of doom.
======================================
Box 1521
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You're joking, that sword is
duller than Dogero.
======================================
Box 1522
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     And uglier than Mi'la.
======================================
Box 1523
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Shutup, you little creep!
======================================
Box 1524
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I've seen that design before. It
may look harmless, but there's more
to it.
======================================
Box 1525
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     Correct. This blade, Gahn crafted
himself. Vonnegut's black anima laughs
in its emptiness.
======================================
Box 1526
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     He's insane\175
======================================
Box 1527
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     The battle, already decided. My
blade, a third eye. It sees all time
as all time. There is no meaning, no
why, only defeat and loss.
======================================
Box 1528
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     Prepare yourself.
======================================
Box 1529
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     The pass is too small, we can't
fight him all at once.
======================================
Box 1530
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I could take him, he's nothing.
======================================
Box 1531
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     Your will is great, but I sense
you lack in certain basics.
======================================
Box 1532
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh shutup and fight!
======================================
Box 1533
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     How about you, Dogero? You could
use the practice.
======================================
Box 1534
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     Practice means nothing to an
empty man. To go on living, Dogero
has created new lies. There is no
why.
======================================
Box 1535
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You're not making any sense.
======================================
Box 1536
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     Nothing makes sense. We are all
blind, that is the nature of
existence.
======================================
Box 1537
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes, the nature of existence to
those who deny existence.
======================================
Box 1538
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     Come, close your eyes, speak to
my blade.
======================================
Box 1539
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Don't look at me!
======================================
Box 1540
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Knock him out.
======================================
Box 1541
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Here goes nothing\175
======================================
Box 1542
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     Dogero leads the children's
crusade{}a duty dance with death{}
I heard Gahn say. Nothing could be
more meaningless.
======================================
Box 1543
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     That sword, I can hear laughter
coming from it.
======================================
Box 1544
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     You remind Vonnegut of what life
was like before he died. So it goes.
======================================
Box 1545
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     A test, you are graded. Next
time, we will show you our true
powers.
======================================
Box 1546
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     Until then: goodbye, hello,
goodbye, hello\175
======================================
Box 1547
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Did you see me? Am I not the
greatest thing ever to use a sword?
He never stood a chance.
======================================
Box 1548
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You had me worried for a moment.
======================================
Box 1549
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I did? You actually worried
about me?
======================================
Box 1550
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Only for a moment.
======================================
Box 1551
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Uh, am I missing something here?
Aren't you going to yell at him?
======================================
Box 1552
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Nope, too tired. Let's go, I
still have those other two to
slaughter.
======================================
Box 1553
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     That was great! Your sword was
all over him! He never had a chance.
======================================
Box 1554
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Psh, that was nothing. Dogero
was holding back; I've seen him fight
better than that.
======================================
Box 1555
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Hmm\175
======================================
Box 1556
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Something wrong?
======================================
Box 1557
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I was wondering; I've seen a
sword like his before\175 it almost
killed me.
======================================
Box 1558
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Almost is failure.
======================================
Box 1559
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Almost is closer than not at all.
======================================
Box 1560
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Failure.
======================================
Box 1561
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It left marks.
======================================
Box 1562
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Only because you allowed it to.
======================================
Box 1563
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     In case you forgot, you're still
alive.
======================================
Box 1564
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You're right, but{}
======================================
Box 1565
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     But nothing! When will you ever
get over that?
======================================
Box 1566
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Don't you remember what kind of
people say \185you're right but',
\185correct, except', \185yes, though'?
======================================
Box 1567
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     The same kind of people you
fought before you decided to give up.
======================================
Box 1568
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     If I am right then say so, if
not, then don't.
======================================
Box 1569
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What does that matter? You know
what he means.
======================================
Box 1570
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Okay, what did he mean?
======================================
Box 1571
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     That you were right except for
whatever he was going to say.
======================================
Box 1572
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh, I see. He said I was right,
but not completely right.
======================================
Box 1573
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yeah.
======================================
Box 1574
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     So, I am right but not right.
======================================
Box 1575
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yeah, so?
======================================
Box 1576
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Is that possible?
======================================
Box 1577
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Uh\175 that would be a
contradiction.
======================================
Box 1578
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Yes.
======================================
Box 1579
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     So? What's the point? You knew
what he meant.
======================================
Box 1580
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You're missing the point, Johan.
She's right, I said that without
thinking what I meant.
======================================
Box 1581
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     But\175
======================================
Box 1582
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     \175nothing.
======================================
Box 1583
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's go.
======================================
Box 1584
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I won!
======================================
Box 1585
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No you didn't, he's still alive.
======================================
Box 1586
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     But{}
======================================
Box 1587
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     But nothing, there's another
catwalk down there.
======================================
Box 1588
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It looked like he won to me.
======================================
Box 1589
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh, and what do you know about
winning?
======================================
Box 1590
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Well?
======================================
Box 1591
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We don't have time for this,
let's go.
======================================
Box 1592
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     That's more like it.
======================================
Box 1593
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Follow me.
======================================
Box 1594
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     There's something really wrong
with her\175 I bet she didn't have many
friends as a pup.
======================================
Box 1595
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It wasn't her fault.
======================================
Box 1596
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What do you mean?
======================================
Box 1597
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I mean, think of all the people
you know in Adlez. Do you find their
company worthwhile?
======================================
Box 1598
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Not really. I used to be
depressed about it before I met
someone from Keltan. He was the first
smart person I met, other than me.
======================================
Box 1599
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     She never met anyone like that
when she was young.
======================================
Box 1600
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yeah, but she's just so stuck-up
and arrogant. It's strange.
======================================
Box 1601
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     If there is anything wrong with
her, it isn't her arrogance.
======================================
Box 1602
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Hey! Are you slackers coming or
not?
======================================
Box 1603
--------------------------------------
======================================
Box 1604
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     You've decided to show up after
all. It wasn't supposed to be like
this, but then again nothing ever is
what it is to be.
======================================
Box 1605
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Looks like he's still not making
any sense.
======================================
Box 1606
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     Looks, can be deceiving; close
your eyes and the deception ends.
======================================
Box 1607
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     They're all blind by choice.
How stupid.
======================================
Box 1608
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     And so are you, by choice you've
stepped into this room, to find
yourselves trapped!
======================================
Box 1609
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     It is not unfair to say that
sight sees everything but itself.
Dogero's eyes look outward the most,
never to see his true nature within.
======================================
Box 1610
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     And you're blind, you don't see
anything at all! Judging Dogero shows
that you look outward, fool.
======================================
Box 1611
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     We are all fools, but you moreso
for denying what you are.
======================================
Box 1612
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     Adlez is ours, mine to rule with
the guidance of Gahn.
======================================
Box 1613
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Why is it yours to rule? Adlez
is worse now than ever before.
======================================
Box 1614
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You've made life out to be some
joke; people laugh at nothing and
everything, but mostly at what is
right\175
======================================
Box 1615
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You've taught them to dismiss
truth, that it doesn't even exist!
======================================
Box 1616
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     Only I comprehend the
complexities of magic; the neutral
area where reality and fantasy make
peace and combine into one.
======================================
Box 1617
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Enough talk, prepare to die.
======================================
Box 1618
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     You have no chance, never did;
but you, Dogero, you were given the
opportunity to give up and accept
destiny, our destiny{}
======================================
Box 1619
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     And look what you have done with
our forgiveness!
======================================
Box 1620
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Normally I would feel bad about
beating up blind people, but I am
going to enjoy this.
======================================
Box 1621
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     Blind, we all will be soon;
embracing our common shortcomings,
we become one in nonexistence.
======================================
Box 1622
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh shutup, I am sick of your
idiocy!
======================================
Box 1623
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     Ha-ha-ha! There is no need for
anger, there is no need for anything!
======================================
Box 1624
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You can trick everyone in Adlez,
but not me.
======================================
Box 1625
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You're cornered in your own
hideout, your henchmen have failed to
kill us, we have been gaining ground,
and you have been retreating.
======================================
Box 1626
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Your tactics may work on those
who doubt themselves, but not us.
======================================
Box 1627
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You'll pay for what you did to
Dangle.
======================================
Box 1628
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We are not going to stand down,
Talvas.
======================================
Box 1629
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     You disappoint us. Gahn had hoped
you would finally begin to look
inward, to realize how hopeless life
is without his guidance\175
======================================
Box 1630
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     We want to help you, yet you
resist, you fight against us!
======================================
Box 1631
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     You are all uncivilized. We bring
you culture, knowledge, and the word
of Gahn{}
======================================
Box 1632
--------------------------------------
[\205 Hellbound]
     ARRGH!
======================================
Box 1633
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     Barbarians!
======================================
Box 1634
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     Come Rift, before their evil
consumes us too.
======================================
Box 1635
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I think that solves the problem
of Adlez.
======================================
Box 1636
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I hope so, they even made Mi'la
look smart.
======================================
Box 1637
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Ow!
======================================
Box 1638
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Gitleh must be in the next room,
let's go.
======================================
Box 1639
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     Greetings, it is I, Gitleh.
======================================
Box 1640
--------------------------------------
[\229 Gitleh]
     Thank you for removing those who
would defile my tomb.
======================================
Box 1641
--------------------------------------
[\229 Gitleh]
     Talvas and his men can never
destroy what is real, that which is
as real and solid as the ground you
stand on.
======================================
Box 1642
--------------------------------------
[\229 Gitleh]
     You have done well to reach me.
What is it that you seek?
======================================
Box 1643
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     They seek you, my love.
======================================
Box 1644
--------------------------------------
[\229 Gitleh]
     So you have found Anon. It is
good to hear her voice again.
======================================
Box 1645
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     Dogero was unable to destroy the
source. He seeks to reunite us to
defeat this new evil.
======================================
Box 1646
--------------------------------------
[\229 Gitleh]
     We were able to defeat Grinlow in
the past; this new evil will not
stand a chance, so long as you gather
us and allow us to meet it.
======================================
Box 1647
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     It seems to be creating unrest
and spreading disorder across the
land, very much like in the past.
======================================
Box 1648
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     Could it be Grinlow himself?
======================================
Box 1649
--------------------------------------
[\229 Gitleh]
     Whatever its ultimate goal, it
must be stopped.
======================================
Box 1650
--------------------------------------
[\229 Gitleh]
     You must find our remaining
allies: Fedora and Shoda. Together,
we should be able to rid the land of
this evil's existence.
======================================
Box 1651
--------------------------------------
[\229 Gitleh]
     You will find Fedora's tomb
within the Desert of Despair.
======================================
Box 1652
--------------------------------------
[\229 Gitleh]
     I shall accompany you, so I may
defend that which is real and true.
======================================

Box 1654
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     You're safe!
======================================
Box 1655
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     No need to explain, Dangle has
told me already.
======================================
Box 1656
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     You should have told me you were
Dogero, I had no idea!
======================================
Box 1657
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     I am honored that you can now add
Adlez to the long list of towns that
you have saved.
======================================
Box 1658
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We really must go.
======================================
Box 1659
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     I would reward you, but\175
======================================
Box 1660
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Adlez is in debt.
======================================
Box 1661
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Yes, the town's treasury has run
dry quite a while ago. I really am in
debt to you, in the truest sense of
the word.
======================================
Box 1662
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Tell ya' what, we can call it
even on one condition.
======================================
Box 1663
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Name it.
======================================
Box 1664
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You cease being in debt to
anyone.
======================================

[\200 Dogero]
     In which direction is the Desert
of Despair?
======================================
Box 1667
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     It is to the east.
======================================
Box 1668
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     The traders who travel across
the desert have not been seen in a
long time.
======================================
Box 1669
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     You'd best be careful if you are
headed that way.
======================================
Box 1670
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Understood. Good day.
======================================
Box 1671
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Johan, where do you think you're
going?
======================================
Box 1672
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     With them.
======================================
Box 1673
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Do you realize what you have
done?
======================================
Box 1674
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     You have skirted your duty to
the people of this town.
======================================
Box 1675
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     You have put yourself and others
into danger by going deep into that
abandoned mine.
======================================
Box 1676
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     You have thoroughly ignored my
orders\175
======================================
Box 1677
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     And I am very proud of you. I
could ask for no greater son.
======================================
Box 1678
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Adlez is a small place in a big
land, and I will not hold you back
here any longer.
======================================
Box 1679
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     What are you waiting for? Get
the hell out of here!
======================================
Box 1680
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Thanks dad, I will miss you.
======================================
Box 1681
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Hurry up before I change my mind.
======================================
Box 1682
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     The old man must have really
given it to you this time.
======================================
Box 1683
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     He didn't, not like you may think
he did, in fact, he was quite proud
of me.
======================================
Box 1684
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Unbelievable, I guess your
father isn't a complete idiot.
======================================
Box 1685
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yeah, it surprised me too.
======================================
Box 1686
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Well, me and Dogero must be
going. It's been great, I hope things
keep looking up for you.
======================================
Box 1687
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Oh, things will. Do you know why?
======================================
Box 1688
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Why?
======================================
Box 1689
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Because I am coming with you.
======================================
Box 1690
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What!
======================================
Box 1691
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     My father has officially kicked
me out of town, so you are stuck with
me.
======================================
Box 1692
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Unbelievable\175
======================================
Box 1693
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Welcome aboard, Johan. Have you
ever left Adlez before?
======================================
Box 1694
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Not really, but I am looking
forward to the life of an adventurer.
======================================
Box 1695
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We're not adventurers.
======================================
Box 1696
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yes we are!
======================================
Box 1697
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     An adventurer is someone who
goes on adventures.
======================================
Box 1698
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Tell us something we don't know.
======================================
Box 1699
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Let me finish! An adventure is
when one travels far away to sell
goods at a profit to people who do
not have them.
======================================
Box 1700
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Exactly!
======================================
Box 1701
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Ah, I see.
======================================
Box 1702
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Okay then, what are our goods?
======================================
Box 1703
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Our services as the justice.
======================================
Box 1704
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We're not protectors.
======================================
Box 1705
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Maybe not in the sense of the
word as it is used today, but in the
classical sense we are.
======================================
Box 1706
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Maybe.
======================================
Box 1707
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     For gold and glory, Mi'la!
======================================
Box 1708
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     For the gold and the glory!
======================================
Box 1709
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Ha-ha, so we are adventurers.
Perhaps it will be okay if you stick
around for a bit.
======================================
Box 1710
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Our next stop is somewhere in
the Desert of Despair. We have to find
Fedora.
======================================
Box 1711
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Let's go!
======================================
Box 1712
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Onward!
======================================
Box 1713
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     This isn't a game, this is
serious.
======================================
Box 1714
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh lighten up, we are serious.
Are you?
======================================
Box 1715
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Of course I'm serious.
======================================
Box 1716
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Then let's go!
======================================
Box 1717
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     For gold and glory!
======================================
Box 1718
--------------------------------------
     Despair and desperation go hand
in hand, in hand and hand. You cannot
fall into one without achieving the
other.
======================================
Box 1719
--------------------------------------
     The blind have it easy, the rest
must watch as the horizon fades into
an empty blackness.
======================================
Box 1720
--------------------------------------
     Death is a lonely place, but it
cannot be much worse than where you
already are, can it?
======================================
Box 1721
--------------------------------------
     You have ${V27} days left.
======================================
Box 1722
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     You are not allowed entrance.
Now be a good chap and move along.
======================================
Box 1723
--------------------------------------
======================================
Box 1724
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We are going in there, even if
we have to go through you.
======================================
Box 1725
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh shutup and get out of the way
before you get hurt.
======================================
Box 1726
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     How about you be a good chap and
let us in.
======================================
Box 1727
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     Sorry sir, but I cannot do that.
======================================
Box 1728
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     So much for the easy way\175
======================================
Box 1729
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     Zzzz\175
======================================
Box 1730
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Quiet, he's sleeping.
======================================
Box 1731
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Silly guard, you can't stay
awake forever.
======================================
Box 1732
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Ha, I told you my plan would
work.
======================================
Box 1733
--------------------------------------
[\228 Dangle]
     Don't go this way. You need to
take the other path.
======================================
Box 1734
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     The Desert of Despair\175
======================================
Box 1735
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It's huge! There is no way I am
going out there. We could easily
become lost.
======================================
Box 1736
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Not if we stick to this path, it
should lead straight into Keltan.
======================================
Box 1737
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It looks like a long walk. We
should stock up on supplies before
heading out.
======================================
Box 1738
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What about what the mayor said?
The traders have died out there. Do
you want to die?
======================================
Box 1739
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     He didn't say that! He just said
that no one has seen the traders\175 in
a long time.
======================================
Box 1740
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     And what do you think that means,
birdbrain?
======================================
Box 1741
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We are going out there.
======================================
Box 1742
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Do we have to?
======================================
Box 1743
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Do you want to stay in Adlez?
======================================
Box 1744
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Not really, but this is a desert!
Of despair!
======================================
Box 1745
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's go.
======================================
Box 1746
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     But Dogero, you know there will
be bad and ugly and scary monsters
out there.
======================================
Box 1747
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's go!
======================================
Box 1748
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Ha-ha, excellent.
======================================
Box 1749
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What is excellent?
======================================
Box 1750
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh, nothing.
======================================
Box 1751
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Don't evade. Why did you say
that?
======================================
Box 1752
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It is nothing, really. Forget I
said it.
======================================
Box 1753
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Don't play games with me.
======================================
Box 1754
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Don't worry, I won't because you
can never catch me. I don't play with
losers.
======================================
Box 1755
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Are you two finished yet? You're
like little children.
======================================
Box 1756
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You're one to talk.
======================================
Box 1757
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Hey! I'm just short for my age,
that's all.
======================================
Box 1758
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We're going. Now.
======================================
Box 1759
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Now is not a good time.
======================================
Box 1760
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Yes, we should keep moving.
======================================
Box 1761
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Why? Aren't any of you tired?
======================================
Box 1762
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Trust me, now is not a good time.
======================================
Box 1763
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We should stop.
======================================
Box 1764
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You see them too?
======================================
Box 1765
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes.
======================================
Box 1766
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     They have stopped moving awhile
ago. Now is the safest time to rest,
if we plan to.
======================================
Box 1767
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Uh, shouldn't we be running if
there are people following us?
======================================
Box 1768
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     They are shadowing us like
professionals. We won't be able to
lose them unless they let us.
======================================
Box 1769
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     So we're just going to give up?
======================================
Box 1770
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh come on, I need to give my
feet a rest, let's take the chance.
======================================
Box 1771
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     There aren't that many, only
about five or six. We can take them
if they are stupid enough to come any
closer.
======================================
Box 1772
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I counted twenty. They are
masking themselves like pros.
======================================
Box 1773
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I don't think this is a good
idea. I've only started out on my
adventure; I don't want it to end
just after leaving town.
======================================
Box 1774
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It won't. Do you know why it
won't?
======================================
Box 1775
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let me guess, because we are with
the all-knowing and self-admiring
Mi'la.
======================================
Box 1776
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     And don't any of you fools forget
that!
======================================
Box 1777
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Maybe I should have stayed in
Adlez.
======================================
Box 1778
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     For gold and glory, Johan!
======================================
Box 1779
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     If it worries you that much, you
can have first watch.
======================================
Box 1780
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Okay, but I'm waking up Mi'la for
second watch.
======================================
Box 1781
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Why me?
======================================
Box 1782
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Because I've heard Dogero has a
habit of attacking people who wake
him up.
======================================
Box 1783
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Fair enough.
======================================
Box 1784
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Is something wrong?
======================================
Box 1785
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Well?
======================================
Box 1786
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I think it best if we slept
spread out.
======================================
Box 1787
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     But it's so cold, do you want me
to freeze to death?
======================================
Box 1788
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No, I don't, but I need my space.
======================================
Box 1789
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Fine, fine, have your space.
I see how it is.
======================================
Box 1790
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Oh boy, here it comes.
======================================
Box 1791
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Shutup, Johan!
======================================
Box 1792
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Since you both hate me, I will
sleep over here, far away from either
of you jerks.
======================================
Box 1793
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Goodnight{}
======================================
Box 1794
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Shutup!
======================================
Box 1795
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Today's the big day! I can hardly
wait.
======================================
Box 1796
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     I've been practicing all week.
======================================
Box 1797
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     I am very confident, I know I can
win this.
======================================
Box 1798
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I'm the fastest one here, there's
no way you'll beat me.
======================================
Box 1799
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I think we should have races like
this everyday.
======================================
Box 1800
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     We would have started sooner,
but you were asleep.
======================================
Box 1801
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You've slept half the day away,
again!
======================================
Box 1802
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Have you been practicing with
your sword? You know I have. We should
spar together after the race.
======================================
Box 1803
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Try not to cry when you lose.
======================================
Box 1804
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     About time you woke up.
======================================
Box 1805
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I am not going to let you win
this race. You always win everything,
and when you don't, Mi'la does.
======================================
Box 1806
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I am tired of losing!
======================================
Box 1807
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Good afternoon, did you rest
well?
======================================
Box 1808
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     That's good. I hope you have
plenty of energy.
======================================
Box 1809
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Ah, well I hope you feel better
now.
======================================
Box 1810
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I am very excited about the race
and didn't want you to miss it. So I
kept everyone waiting for you.
======================================
Box 1811
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     But now that you are up, it's
time to play!
======================================
Box 1812
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     I'm ready to go!
======================================
Box 1813
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I hope you do well.
======================================
Box 1814
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Hurry up! Quit stalling.
======================================
Box 1815
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Get in your spot.
======================================
Box 1816
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I know it is only a game, but
that doesn't stop me from being
nervous.
======================================
Box 1817
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You're pretty fast, but I'm
faster!
======================================
Box 1818
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You do know that I am only pacing
with you, right?
======================================
Box 1819
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Come on! I know you're faster
than that!
======================================
Box 1820
--------------------------------------
[\214 Judge]
     And here they come!
======================================
Box 1821
--------------------------------------
[\214 Judge]
     Dogero wins the race!
======================================
Box 1822
--------------------------------------
[\214 Judge]
     And right behind him is Mi'la
in a close second\175 where is everyone
else?
======================================
Box 1823
--------------------------------------
[\214 Judge]
     Those two have blown the
competition away!
======================================
Box 1824
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     *Huff*, *Huff*, let me catch my
breath\175
======================================
Box 1825

[\211 Scarf]
     I know I could have ran faster
without all of these clothes, but I
feel so cold all of the time. You
know how it is.
======================================
Box 1826
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     I'll win the next one!
======================================
Box 1827
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Good race, Dogero. I would have
beaten you but I sprang my ankle
halfway through.
======================================
Box 1828
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I am not a sore loser, but I am
still a sore loser. That's no fun!
======================================
Box 1829
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Even though I sprang my ankle,
I still managed to beat Scarf, ha-ha!
======================================
Box 1830
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     You might be faster, but that
doesn't make you better.
======================================
Box 1831
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I'm the best all-around.
======================================
Box 1832
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     One day I will be stronger. I am
tired of being so weak.
======================================
Box 1833
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Congratulations Dogero, but I
think we're all winners for finishing.
======================================
Box 1834
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I'm not really good at these kind
of games; I prefer ones where we play
in teams.
======================================
Box 1835
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     It is good to see you beat Mi'la.
She won't be able to brag thanks to
you!
======================================
Box 1836
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Why are you away from the crowd?
You're the winner today, go and enjoy
it.
======================================
Box 1837
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I'm fine, don't worry about me.
I don't care for the attention.
======================================
Box 1838
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Why are you still here? Go
celebrate with everyone else.
======================================
Box 1839
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     This is the last day of the fall
fair. It only comes around once every
four seasons, don't miss it.
======================================
Box 1840
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You're the big winner, everyone
loves you, aren't you happy?
======================================
Box 1841
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     This is boring, do you want to
race again? Come on, it'll be fun!
======================================
Box 1842
--------------------------------------

     Mi'la.
======================================
Box 1843
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What?
======================================
Box 1844
--------------------------------------

     Mi'la\175
======================================
Box 1845
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Heh-heh-heh\175
======================================
Box 1846
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What is so funny? You didn't see
anything!
======================================
Box 1847
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Lies tell more than they hide.
======================================
Box 1848
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Tell anyone and you die.
======================================
Box 1849
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Your secret's safe with me.
======================================
Box 1850
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It better be, or else.
======================================
Box 1851
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Anyway, sorry for not waking you
up.
======================================
Box 1852
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Wait\175 you fell asleep on your
watch?
======================================
Box 1853
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yeah, but we're okay. Well, at
least me and Dogero are okay, don't
know about you.
======================================
Box 1854
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You fool! Why didn't you wake me
up?
======================================
Box 1855
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Because I fell asleep? Is that a
trick question?
======================================
Box 1856
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Look, I'm sorry Mi'la, but you
knew that I'm new at this, and I told
you this wasn't a good idea.
======================================
Box 1857
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Mmm\175
======================================
Box 1858
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Get up!
======================================
Box 1859
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     The icons, they're gone.
======================================
Box 1860
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Which ones?
======================================
Box 1861
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Anon's and Gitleh's.
======================================
Box 1862
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Well this is going to set us
back a bit.
======================================
Box 1863
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You think?
======================================
Box 1864
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Hmm.
======================================
Box 1865
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     They aren't shadowing us anymore.
Looks like they got what they wanted.
======================================
Box 1866
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What do we do now?
======================================
Box 1867
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I'm not sure.
======================================
Box 1868
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Ha, that's nothing new.
======================================
Box 1869
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I say we continue east to Keltan.
They might know where to find\175 which
one are we looking for here?
======================================
Box 1870
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Scatterbrain.
======================================
Box 1871
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I said I'm sorry!
======================================
Box 1872
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We're looking for Fedora.
======================================
Box 1873
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I'm sure we can get those icons
back.
======================================
Box 1874
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     The thieves must have something
to do with the traders disappearing.
We're sure to find them around here.
======================================
Box 1875
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     All right, let's not waste
anymore time. We'll go to Keltan and
work from there.
======================================
Box 1876
--------------------------------------
[\203 ????]
     Halt.
======================================
Box 1877
--------------------------------------
[\203 ????]
     I thought I had made it clear
that you are not welcome. Why have
you returned?
======================================
Box 1878
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What are you talking about? We've
never been here before.
======================================
Box 1879
--------------------------------------
[\203 ????]
     I do not want to fight you.
======================================
Box 1880
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Yeah, because you know you'll
lose.
======================================
Box 1881
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Look at you! You're just another
monster. Let me guess, you're the
town's protector and coincidentally,
the source of all its problems.
======================================
Box 1882
--------------------------------------
[\203 ????]
     You have no idea.
======================================
Box 1883
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Ignore her, we are not looking
for a fight.
======================================
Box 1884
--------------------------------------
[\203 ????]
     Yet you've come back.
======================================
Box 1885
--------------------------------------
[\203 ????]
     I am tired of this. I am not
going back with you. I am not going
to work for him anymore. Accept that.
======================================
Box 1886
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What are you talking about?
======================================
Box 1887
--------------------------------------
[\203 ????]
     If you want to kill me, go ahead
and try.
======================================
Box 1888
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Looks like there is going to be
another dead monster in a few moments.
======================================
Box 1889
--------------------------------------
[\203 ????]
     I welcome death. It is better
than life as one of you.
======================================
Box 1890
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Who are you?
======================================
Box 1891
--------------------------------------
[\203 ????]
     You were the ones who made me
into this! Leave me be; I am tired of
running, I am tired of hiding, I am
tired of all of this.
======================================
Box 1892
--------------------------------------
[\203 ????]
     This is not what being a
protector should be.
======================================
Box 1893
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     No, wait!
======================================
Box 1894
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Pyrus, is that you?
======================================
Box 1895
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Greetings Johan, I did not see
you there. My eyes have been failing
me.
======================================
Box 1896
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     How do you know this thing? I
thought you said you have never left
Adlez.
======================================
Box 1897
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     He came with some traders a long
time ago\175
======================================
Box 1898
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What happened? You look\175
different.
======================================
Box 1899
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Is this Keltan?
======================================
Box 1900
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     There is no Keltan.
======================================
Box 1901
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Impossible! Keltan's supposed to
be the jewel of the desert, the
biggest and best city in the land\175
======================================
Box 1902
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     This is all that is left of the
survivors, or those that chose to run
away.
======================================
Box 1903
--------------------------------------

     A new order of protectors took
control and sent it into poverty. Only
a few realized it, but by then it was
too late.
======================================
Box 1904
--------------------------------------

     I don't even know when it was
too late. I was fooled into it along
with everyone else.
======================================
Box 1905
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I left along with those you'll
find here, but scouts have already
found us a few days ago. I thought you
were one of them, their leader.
======================================
Box 1906
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Dart\175
======================================
Box 1907
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     He looks just like me. This isn't
good if he is around here. We don't
stand a chance against Gahn's core
protectors.
======================================
Box 1908
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I wouldn't worry about the
protectors in Keltan, or what's left
of them. They are nothing compared to
Dart and his group.
======================================
Box 1909
--------------------------------------

     They hit us yesterday, at night.
They used the same tactic on Keltan.
======================================
Box 1910
--------------------------------------

     They first create a problem,
sending everyone into despair and
confusion, to then come in as the
only ones who can solve it.
======================================
Box 1911
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You should join us.
======================================
Box 1912
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     When did you become our leader,
you little snot?
======================================
Box 1913
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Pyrus, please join us.
======================================
Box 1914
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I cannot. I must stay and
protect everyone here.
======================================
Box 1915
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I owe it to them. I must make up
for my failure. I have to learn to
deal with this guilt. I could have
stopped them. I know I could have.
======================================
Box 1916
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     But it doesn't matter anymore. I
can only wait for the inevitable and
accept it when it comes. There is
nothing else I can do.
======================================
Box 1917
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Do you know where we can find the
tomb of Fedora?
======================================
Box 1918
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I have read that it is somewhere
in the desert, but I do not know where
exactly. The sands of time have
covered it along with its whereabouts.
======================================
Box 1919
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You are welcome to stay as long
as you like. There is no point in
running; Gahn will find us all
eventually.
======================================
Box 1920
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I somewhat hope it is sooner
rather than later. The wait is
killing me.
======================================
Box 1921
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I think it best if we split up
and search the town for leads. We
must get Anon's and Gitleh's icons
back.
======================================
Box 1922
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Knowing Dart, he is probably
hiding somewhere close, maybe even in
this town. I'm going to look for him.
======================================
Box 1923
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     While we are here, we should buy
more appropriate clothes. This desert
weather is terrible.
======================================
Box 1924
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I agree. We need clothes suited
for the extreme temperatures, that
and we may be here a while.
======================================
Box 1925
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Good idea, you go buy them.
======================================
Box 1926
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Hey! You were the one who
suggested it, why don't you go buy
them?
======================================
Box 1927
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Because you are.
======================================
Box 1928
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     No I'm not!
======================================
Box 1929
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Yes you are.
======================================
Box 1930
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What do you plan to do?
======================================
Box 1931
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     That's really none of your
business.
======================================
Box 1932
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We'll meet back here when
everyone is finished.
======================================
Box 1933
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     But\175
======================================
Box 1934
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     For gold and glory, Johan!
======================================
Box 1935
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     \175fine.
======================================
Box 1936
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shopkeeper]
     Hello there! Are you interested
in any fabrics?
======================================
Box 1937
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yes I am, actually. Do you have
any desert clothing I could buy?
======================================
Box 1938
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shopkeeper]
     We're in the desert, aren't we
boy? What are you looking for?
======================================
Box 1939
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Three of your best outfits.
======================================
Box 1940
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shopkeeper]
     My best, huh? That will cost you
three hundred and fifteen bits.
======================================
Box 1941
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Um\175 that's quite a lot.
======================================
Box 1942
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shopkeeper]
     Dont worry, if you can't afford
them, then I am sure I have cheaper
ones that may interest you.
======================================
Box 1943
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shopkeeper]
     Hello there, friend. May I help
you?
======================================
Box 1944
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     This doesn't look good.
======================================
Box 1945
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shopkeeper]
     Quick, into the basement!
======================================
Box 1946
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I thought you were looking for
Dart.
======================================
Box 1947
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I was, but it is useless. I'll
never find him.
======================================
Box 1948
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You never find anything until it
finds you.
======================================
Box 1949
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     That is not true.
======================================
Box 1950
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh really? Have you found the
person who sent you that note in
Fralin yet?
======================================
Box 1951
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I think I may have\175
======================================
Box 1952
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Just forget it.
======================================
Box 1953
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You know I cannot just willingly
forget anything.
======================================
Box 1954
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Yes, that is one of your better
qualities.
======================================
Box 1955
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Why were you following me?
======================================
Box 1956
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh, it was nothing.
======================================
Box 1957
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Stop that!
======================================
Box 1958
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I know what is going on, Mi'la.
======================================
Box 1959
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Do you?
======================================
Box 1960
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What are you hiding?
======================================
Box 1961
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I am not hiding anything. If you
weren't so blind, you'd see that.
======================================
Box 1962
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We sure have come a long way,
haven't we?
======================================
Box 1963
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     There's still a long way for us
to go, but yes, we have.
======================================
Box 1964
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I never understood something,
and I have been meaning to ask you
about it.
======================================
Box 1965
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What better time than now? Go
ahead.
======================================
Box 1966
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Why did you let me win that race?
======================================
Box 1967
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Ha-ha-ha, you actually remember
that? That was a long time ago, and
quite trivial.
======================================
Box 1968
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     If it was, then why do you
remember it?
======================================
Box 1969
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Because\175
======================================
Box 1970
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes?
======================================
Box 1971
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     \175
======================================
Box 1972
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     They're going to break through!
======================================
Box 1973
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shopkeeper]
     Don't worry, boy, we won't go
down without a fight. I have a special
surprise for them, a weapon I have
been tinkering with.
======================================
Box 1974
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Here they come!
======================================
Box 1975
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Did you hear that?
======================================
Box 1976
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Come on, let's go!
======================================
Box 1977
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Who were those guys?
======================================
Box 1978
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shopkeeper]
     I think they were the midnight
raiders, the thugs who attacked us a
few days ago.
======================================
Box 1979
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shopkeeper]
     What are you looking at?
======================================
Box 1980
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     My, you sure do have a lot of
gold.
======================================
Box 1981
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shopkeeper]
     And you're thinking of stealing
some?
======================================
Box 1982
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Of course not! I'm not a thief,
you stupid old man.
======================================
Box 1983
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yeah, we are looking to earn
gold, not steal it.
======================================
Box 1984
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shopkeeper]
     Whew, that's one less thing I've
to worry about. I've been the only
person who's known about this place
until today.
======================================
Box 1985
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shopkeeper]
     I am grateful for your help, so
tell you what: I'll give you those
clothes you wanted, on the house.
======================================
Box 1986
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Thanks!
======================================
Box 1987
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I noticed your weapon is able to
fire more than one shot at a time,
may I see it?
======================================
Box 1988
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shopkeeper]
     Sure thing.
======================================
Box 1989
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     This is a nice piece of work.
======================================
Box 1990
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shopkeeper]
     Thanks, but it locks up on me all
the time. Still haven't figured out
how to fix that yet.
======================================
Box 1991
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     May I trade weapons with you?
======================================
Box 1992
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shopkeeper]
     I don't want to trade you a
broken one for a reliable one. You
saved me and my gold, after all.
======================================
Box 1993
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I insist.
======================================
Box 1994
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shopkeeper]
     If you say so.
======================================
Box 1995
--------------------------------------
    \169 Traded \151 Pistol for \152 Auto \169
======================================
Box 1996
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shopkeeper]
     The name's Bill, and it was a
pleasure doing business with you.
======================================
Box 1997
--------------------------------------
     \169 Received Desert Clothing \169
======================================
Box 1998
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     These clothes are much better.
======================================
Box 1999
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Fixed my new weapon, I'm ready
to go.
======================================
Box 2000
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     So, where to next?
======================================
Box 2001
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I don't know. I have no idea
what to do. We don't have any leads,
besides those thugs.
======================================
Box 2002
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Now that we are better dressed,
I think it's time we scoured the
desert.
======================================
Box 2003
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Are you serious? That would be
like finding a needle in a haystack,
and that's even if Dart or whoever is
still around with the icons.
======================================
Box 2004
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I was kidding. I'm as lost as
you are.
======================================
Box 2005
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     That's a first.
======================================
Box 2006
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh shutup.
======================================
Box 2007
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What are we going to do?
======================================
Box 2008
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     We're not going to give up, are
we?
======================================
Box 2009
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Of course not.
======================================
Box 2010
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We won't find Dart, Dart will
find us. I think our only option is
searching the desert.
======================================
Box 2011
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You kid.
======================================
Box 2012
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I do not.
======================================
Box 2013
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     This is hopeless.
======================================
Box 2014
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's stock up on anything we may
need and leave town. We may be out
there for a long time.
======================================
Box 2015
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Ugh, there has to be a better
way.
======================================
Box 2016
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I heard about what you did.
======================================
Box 2017
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I should have been there.
======================================
Box 2018
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You shouldn't feel so guilty all
the time, it isn't natural.
======================================
Box 2019
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Where are you headed, if you
don't mind me asking?
======================================
Box 2020
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We don't know. We plan to roam
the desert looking for a lead to get
back something that was stolen from
us.
======================================
Box 2021
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I see. That is not ideal at all.
======================================
Box 2022
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Wait a second\175 I have a better
idea!
======================================
Box 2023
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     The raiders are connected to
Dart, and they are going to hit this
town again, aren't they?
======================================
Box 2024
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I am expecting it.
======================================
Box 2025
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     And Gahn's forces used Gitleh's
tomb as their center of operations, so
these raiders must be using Fedora's
tomb.
======================================
Box 2026
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Hmm, Anon's tomb was used as a
hideout too. You may be on to
something.
======================================
Box 2027
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     All we need to do is wait for
the raiders to come back and follow
them to Fedora!
======================================
Box 2028
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We'll wait for them here.
======================================
Box 2029
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You are welcome to stay for as
long as you like. I am sure everyone
will feel safer with you three around.
======================================
Box 2030
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Thank you.
======================================
Box 2031
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Follow me, I will arrange for
your room and board.
======================================
Box 2032
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We'll look around in the desert.
======================================
Box 2033
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Ah, come on! It makes more sense
to wait here.
======================================
Box 2034
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You can always come back if you
change your mind.
======================================
Box 2035
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Have you changed your mind?
======================================
Box 2036
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes, we'll wait for the raiders
here.
======================================
Box 2037
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No, we're still looking around in
the desert.
======================================
Box 2038
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I say we wait. We are wasting
valuable time\175
======================================
Box 2039
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Hey Dogero.
======================================
Box 2040
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Hey.
======================================
Box 2041
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I can't sleep.
======================================
Box 2042
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Me neither.
======================================
Box 2043
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Do you sometimes think\175 no,
forget it.
======================================
Box 2044
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You can say it.
======================================
Box 2045
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Do you sometimes wonder if there
is a thing out there, something that
decides what happens\175
======================================
Box 2046
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Something that controls events
and is the reason things happen the
way they do?
======================================
Box 2047
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No, not really.
======================================
Box 2048
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     That would be amazing if there
were something like that though.
======================================
Box 2049
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Do you really think so?
======================================
Box 2050
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I think something like that
exists out there. It has to. How else
can we explain things?
======================================
Box 2051
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Just imagining it makes me feel
less lonely and helpless.
======================================
Box 2052
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     How are you lonely and helpless?
Everyone likes you Manx, you're the
smartest person I know.
======================================
Box 2053
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I feel so lost all the time, like
my life is in the wind. I need
direction.
======================================
Box 2054
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I guess I'm tired of being a kid.
======================================
Box 2055
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I want to have a purpose, maybe
something like my own family, a child
of my own.
======================================
Box 2056
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I would raise her right. I would
be that thing that controls events
and decides what happens to her.
======================================
Box 2057
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I'm sorry about your parents. I
never really had the chance to know
mine.
======================================
Box 2058
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     It's okay. Everything's okay.
It's just that I want to believe there
is a reason for things.
======================================
Box 2059
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Look at the moon, isn't it
beautiful?
======================================
Box 2060
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I like to think it is watching
over us.
======================================
Box 2061
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     There has to be something great
out there, something that determines
our fate\175
======================================
Box 2062
--------------------------------------
               Help me!
======================================
Box 2063
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Who is that?
======================================
Box 2064
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     It sounds like someone is in
trouble, let's hurry.
======================================
Box 2065
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Get away! Somebody help me!
======================================
Box 2066
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     The animals can talk\175 Get over
here, you have to see this!
======================================
Box 2067
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Do it again, say something!
======================================
Box 2068
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Help me! Help! Someone, anyone!
======================================
Box 2069
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Oh, look, there's more of them,
what a discovery!
======================================
Box 2070
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     They're giants.
======================================
Box 2071
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Who are you?
======================================
Box 2072
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Us? Ha, we're nothing now, just
two exiles wandering the land.
======================================
Box 2073
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Boss, I'm going to keep this one
as a pet.
======================================
Box 2074
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     No, get away from me!
======================================
Box 2075
--------------------------------------
[\210 ????]
     They are not animals. Do not
touch her.
======================================
Box 2076
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     But boss\175
======================================
Box 2077
--------------------------------------
[\210 ????]
     They are like the animals back
home in appearance only. They possess
true intelligence, true animals do
not.
======================================
Box 2078
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Well screw you! We're far away
from home, aren't we? I don't have to
listen to you anymore.
======================================
Box 2079
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Look at where you got us{}you're
a failure, you have failed!
======================================
Box 2080
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     The rules don't apply here. I'm
keeping it as my own.
======================================
Box 2081
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Please, help me\175
======================================
Box 2082
--------------------------------------
[\210 ????]
     Why have you waited until now to
show me your true colors?
======================================
Box 2083
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     It's mine! I can make decisions
on my own, without your help. You
don't control me anymore.
======================================
Box 2084
--------------------------------------
[\210 ????]
     Then the world has no need of
you.
======================================
Box 2085
--------------------------------------
[\210 ????]
     I am sorry you had to witness
this.
======================================
Box 2086
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Are you okay?
======================================
Box 2087
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     She's not moving.
======================================
Box 2088
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     What's the fuss out here?
======================================
Box 2089
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Who are you!
======================================
Box 2090
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     What has happened?
======================================
Box 2091
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     You, come with us!
======================================
Box 2092
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It sounds like there is fighting
outside. I should wake the others,
fast.
======================================
Box 2093
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Wakeup!
======================================
Box 2094
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Shutup, I'm sleeping.
======================================
Box 2095
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Wakeup, Mi'la!
======================================
Box 2096
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Okay, okay, you don't have to
yell.
======================================
Box 2097
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Wakeup!
======================================
Box 2098
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What's the matter?
======================================
Box 2099
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     There is trouble outside.
======================================
Box 2100
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Let's check it out.
======================================
Box 2101
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What's going on here?
======================================
Box 2102
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Raiders are attacking. I will
join you in a moment.
======================================
Box 2103
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     The more of them I kill, the
better I feel.
======================================
Box 2104
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     They must have a leader, possibly
Dart.
======================================
Box 2105
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     If we defeat him, it should be
enough to send them into a retreat,
so we can follow them into Fedora's
tomb.
======================================
Box 2106
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Let us wipe them all out.
======================================
Box 2107
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Either way is good with me.
======================================
Box 2108
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     All right. Let's get to work.
======================================
Box 2109
--------------------------------------

     The main force has fallen. Meet
them at the entrance.
======================================
Box 2110
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     The remaining force will be at
the entrance.
======================================
Box 2111
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You heard it too?
======================================
Box 2112
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes, I have been hearing that
voice for a long time. I thought I
was the only one who could.
======================================
Box 2113
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Hmm.
======================================
Box 2114
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What are you two talking about?
======================================
Box 2115
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Apparently both of them are able
to hear strange voices, due to them
both being crazy.
======================================
Box 2116
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's check the entrance.
======================================
Box 2117
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     These are the last ones.
======================================
Box 2118
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You will pay for what you've
done!
======================================
Box 2119
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Another wolf monster masquerading
as a protector, what do you know? I'm
here to save everyone from you.
======================================
Box 2120
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I may look like a monster, but
that doesn't make me one. You have
done wrong to come here and attack us.
And I will kill you for that.
======================================
Box 2121
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Kill me? That's not very heroic.
======================================
Box 2122
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     We're not the bad guys here.
======================================
Box 2123
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     It's all relative anyway. Whoever
wins will be the hero. A hero is only
whoever has the most power.
======================================
Box 2124
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     That is not true; those who are
right and fight for it will be right
whether they win or lose.
======================================
Box 2125
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Do not talk to me with authority,
Dogero! You have no idea what you've
caused parading around as some kind of
high and mighty hero!
======================================
Box 2126
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     You are the reason I even had to
resort to fighting; you are to blame
for every wrong thing that has
happened to me.
======================================
Box 2127
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Stop whining, you're acting like
a loser. Either support your claims
or shutup.
======================================
Box 2128
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You came because of Dogero? Then
why have you allowed your forces to
attack those not to blame?
======================================
Box 2129
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     No one is innocent, monster. We
all have guilt, some more than others.
You should know better than any of us.
Everyone is a part of the problem.
======================================
Box 2130
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What you've done is wrong. I
don't know who you are, but I can
hear the despair in your words.
======================================
Box 2131
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You've failed to explain why
we're wrong. You only think we are,
and you and I both know thoughts do
not shape truth.
======================================
Box 2132
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     If you must fight me, then here
I am. Show me how right you are.
======================================
Box 2133
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     You may think you're right, but
you're not. You are irresponsible and
wrong. You are not one to pass
judgement on anyone.
======================================
Box 2134
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Now die!
======================================
Box 2135
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     They're getting away! We have to
follow them.
======================================
Box 2136
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     There will be no need for that.
I will show you the way. It will be
up to you whether you choose to follow
it or not.
======================================
Box 2137
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You are the one responsible for
these attacks. I will not allow you
to leave here alive.
======================================
Box 2138
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Why bother? Can't stop the
inevitable, can't run forever, can't
solve your own problems; you're just
like Dogero.
======================================
Box 2139
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You don't really believe in that
nonsense, do you?
======================================
Box 2140
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Of course not. It has been awhile
Mi'la, good to see you're still sharp.
======================================
Box 2141
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Why did you stay with Gahn?
======================================
Box 2142
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I have my reasons.
======================================
Box 2143
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I am tired of talking. If you
want to find their hideout, follow
the markers I will place. They will
lead you to the entrance.
======================================
Box 2144
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     You will find what you are
looking for there.
======================================
Box 2145
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Why are you helping us?
======================================
Box 2146
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I said I have my reasons.
======================================
Box 2147
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     We both have the same goal, just
different means.
======================================
Box 2148
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Can we trust him?
======================================
Box 2149
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I don't think we have a choice.
We'll have to accept what fate gives
us.
======================================
Box 2150
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You're such an idiot.
======================================
Box 2151
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Just because there is only one
rational choice doesn't mean there
aren't any other choices.
======================================
Box 2152
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     There is always the choice to
live or die, to move or idle in the
pursuit of one's goal.
======================================
Box 2153
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Take control of your mind and
your actions. If you don't, who will?
======================================
Box 2154
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     She speaks the truth. Dart has
presented us with the only acceptable
choice, and we should take it.
======================================
Box 2155
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     No matter what happens, there
will be no regrets, because this is
the best choice we have. We would be
fools not to take it.
======================================
Box 2156
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Better to spend time than waste
it.
======================================
Box 2157
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I see now that it was foolish for
me to wait for them. I had accepted
defeat, and death, rather than fight
against it.
======================================
Box 2158
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I am coming with you. We will
destroy the source of the problem,
or die trying.
======================================
Box 2159
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     All right.
======================================
Box 2160
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No regrets.
======================================
Box 2161
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's go.
======================================
Box 2162
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Good to see you chose my way.
======================================
Box 2163
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Are you sure you wouldn't rather
wait and die in New Keltan, Pyrus?
======================================
Box 2164
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I would kill you where you stand,
but you appear to be assisting us.
Are you, or is this a trap?
======================================
Box 2165
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Only the weak have need of traps.
Don't insult me. If I wanted you dead,
you wouldn't be here.
======================================
Box 2166
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You led us to the side of a
mountain. I don't see any tomb.
======================================
Box 2167
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     The entrance is hidden. You
should be able to find and open it
from here.
======================================
Box 2168
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Why can't you join us?
======================================
Box 2169
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I work alone.
======================================
Box 2170
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Other people slow me down.
======================================
Box 2171
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     One last thing I should tell you
before I take my leave:
======================================
Box 2172
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Manx is in charge here.
======================================
Box 2173
--------------------------------------

     His tactics were disgusting, but
Gahn was able to convince her to pick
her blade up again.
======================================
Box 2174
--------------------------------------

     She had settled down, as she had
always wanted. Had a child, seemed
bright from what little time I knew
him.
======================================
Box 2175
--------------------------------------

     That child was all she lived for,
or at least that is what she would
say.
======================================
Box 2176
--------------------------------------

     I don't think she ever realized
how selfless she had become. Gahn did,
of course.
======================================
Box 2177
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Watch your back in there; you
are the target of her rage.
======================================
Box 2178
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Why don't you stay and fight
with us?
======================================
Box 2179
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I do not have the heart to fight
her.
======================================
Box 2180
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Besides, it doesn't matter in
the long run. Different means to the
same end, you'll see.
======================================
Box 2181
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Manx, why are you doing this?
======================================
Box 2182
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     \175
======================================
Box 2183
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You ran from Gahn, and now you
are carrying out his will. What
happened?
======================================
Box 2184
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I hate you.
======================================
Box 2185
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I shouldn't be here, none of this
should have happened, but it did. I
cannot evade that.
======================================
Box 2186
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     So long as you are not evading
reality, it is not too late to switch
sides.
======================================
Box 2187
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Don't talk to me about your
reality! You have no right, none of
you do!
======================================
Box 2188
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I am fed up with you, Mi'la, you
were always disgustingly self-
indulgent; it makes you worthless and
ugly.
======================================
Box 2189
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     And Dogero! You have caused me
all this harm with what you probably
think are noble acts{}
======================================
Box 2190
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     And you want me to stand down
as if everything is okay?
======================================
Box 2191
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Manx, I know you don't know me,
but we're not here to hurt you. Dogero
and Mi'la are the good guys.
======================================
Box 2192
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Listen to the child. I was once
like you, and I realized that by
putting faith in Gahn I had become a
monster.
======================================
Box 2193
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     It is not too late to take
control of your own direction.
======================================
Box 2194
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I have complete control of my
direction! It is my sole purpose in
life to see you fall, like all heroes
do.
======================================
Box 2195
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Manx, you once told me that you
believed there was something that
decided your direction for you.
======================================
Box 2196
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Is the purpose you have truly
yours, or did he make that decision
for you?
======================================
Box 2197
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Shutup, Dogero! I can't stand
you!
======================================
Box 2198
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     My direction is my own.
======================================
Box 2199
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     My direction is my own!
======================================
Box 2200
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It doesn't matter how many times
you say it, it still won't be true.
======================================
Box 2201
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     What's wrong Mi'la? Do I not
comply with your perfect little
worldview?
======================================
Box 2202
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     You are blind with conceit. To go
around believing there is such a thing
as right and wrong is irresponsible
and harmful to everyone involved.
======================================
Box 2203
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     How is it harmful? We're the
good guys!
======================================
Box 2204
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     It is all relative. Whoever wins
will be right. Whoever is wrong will
be dead and forgotten.
======================================
Box 2205
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Right and wrong are not relative!
======================================
Box 2206
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Was it right for Gahn to kill
your son? Will it ever be right?
======================================
Box 2207
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Gahn didn't kill him, you did!
======================================
Box 2208
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     And who told you that? Can't you
see he is the cause of your anger?
======================================
Box 2209
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Everyone wants to believe there
is a reason for things, you're not
alone in that want, Manx.
======================================
Box 2210
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I understand now that there is a
reason why things happen the way they
do, and that is because of choices.
======================================
Box 2211
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Your actions have consequences,
consequences that affect you and
everyone around you.
======================================
Box 2212
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Do not blame it on chance or the
unknown!
======================================
Box 2213
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I blame them on you. My fate is
my own, and you and only you have
given it to me.
======================================
Box 2214
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Don't allow yourself to be
controlled by him. You're better than
this, I know you are.
======================================
Box 2215
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Again with the irresponsible
worldview! People aren't good or bad
but a mix of the two.
======================================
Box 2216
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Actions are the only things that
can be good or bad, you stupid fool!
You don't hate Dogero, you hate Dogero
killing your son!
======================================
Box 2217
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     You're no more a hero than I am
or he is. If anything, I am more of a
hero because my whole world has
collapsed in on itself.
======================================
Box 2218
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Yet I still fight for it, even
though I can never have it now. I
can't go back, none of us can.
======================================
Box 2219
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You are fighting for something
you lost and can never have for
reasons given to you by someone else.
======================================
Box 2220
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It is as black and white as that.
======================================
Box 2221
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I am tired of arguing. If I am
wrong, then let me die. I really do
not have anything left to live for,
except to serve Gahn.
======================================
Box 2222
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Fate and Chance, come to my aid!
======================================
Box 2223
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I think they were once like you
and me, but they are monsters now.
======================================
Box 2224
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     No\175 what have you done?
======================================
Box 2225
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Oh, yes, I forgot. Gahn did say
you would know them. Keltan's best
and brightest, they sure do live up
to that name, don't they?
======================================
Box 2226
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Kill them!
======================================
Box 2227
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Dogero\175
======================================
Box 2228
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I'm here, Manx.
======================================
Box 2229
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Dogero\175
======================================
Box 2230
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I'm sorry\175
======================================
Box 2231
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Why did this have to happen.
======================================
Box 2232
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     She chose her fate; she wanted
to die. There is no reason to feel
sorry for her.
======================================
Box 2233
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     How can you say that? Have a
heart, Mi'la.
======================================
Box 2234
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I have one{}we all do for having
done what we did.
======================================
Box 2235
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It was Dart who didn't have the
heart to confront her in her
condition.
======================================
Box 2236
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yeah, real compassionate, we
killed her.
======================================
Box 2237
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     She welcomed death, Johan. She
got what she wanted.
======================================
Box 2238
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     She was misguided as are the rest
of the protectors. They have become
monsters.
======================================
Box 2239
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     We must stop this from ever
happening again.
======================================
Box 2240
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Agreed.
======================================
Box 2241
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I never want to see this again.
======================================
Box 2242
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I have heard stories of her, but
I had never thought I would meet her
in person.
======================================
Box 2243
--------------------------------------
[\223 ????]
     Who are you?
======================================
Box 2244
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I am Dogero, and you must be
Fedora?
======================================
Box 2245
--------------------------------------
[\223 Fedora]
     Correct. Now, tell me why you
are here.
======================================
Box 2246
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We're here for you.
======================================
Box 2247
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We were instructed by Anon and
Gitleh to find you. We need your help
to defeat a monster.
======================================
Box 2248
--------------------------------------
[\223 Fedora]
     Where are they?
======================================
Box 2249
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     They were stolen. We have to get
them back.
======================================
Box 2250
--------------------------------------
[\223 Fedora]
     Ha-ha, they were always
intolerably unskilled.
======================================
Box 2251
--------------------------------------
[\223 Fedora]
     I suspect you'll want me to come
along. I will be glad to, but I will
sure miss this place.
======================================
Box 2252
--------------------------------------
[\223 Fedora]
     The sooner you find us all, the
sooner we can defeat whatever monster.
We are undefeatable, you know.
======================================
Box 2253
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Do you know where the fourth
valorian is?
======================================
Box 2254
--------------------------------------
[\223 Fedora]
     Shoda? I have no idea where she
is.
======================================
Box 2255
--------------------------------------
[\223 Fedora]
     If you were able to find Anon,
Gitleh, and me, then I am sure you
can find her.
======================================
Box 2256
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     That doesn't help.
======================================
Box 2257
--------------------------------------
[\223 Fedora]
     Who said I was helping you find
them? I am only tagging along for the
action. It's your job to reunite us.
======================================
Box 2258
--------------------------------------
[\223 Fedora]
     Do not lose me like you did the
others, or you will regret it!
======================================
Box 2259
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     She must be the oddball of the
group, kind of like Mi'la is with us.
======================================
Box 2260
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh shutup. We are all oddballs
in that sense, fox-face.
======================================
Box 2261
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's hurry up and get out of
here.
======================================
Box 2262
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Now that the raider threat is no
more, and you have found what you were
looking for, I can return to New
Keltan.
======================================
Box 2263
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You're not going to stay with us?
======================================
Box 2264
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I have made up my mind. I feel
out of place with you. You are all
full of life, and I feel worn out.
======================================
Box 2265
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I fear if I remain with you, I
may become like Manx. It angers me to
see what Gahn has caused.
======================================
Box 2266
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     It angers me more to be reminded
of what I allowed him to do to me.
======================================
Box 2267
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Of course it angers you, it
angers me too. Anger is not a bad
thing; it can be a useful and pure
emotion just like any other.
======================================
Box 2268
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Check the circumstances for your
anger, it is not the same as hers,
is it?
======================================
Box 2269
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     No, it is not. But it is my
decision to make, and I have made my
choice.
======================================
Box 2270
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Fair enough. At least take Johan
with you, we don't really need him.
======================================
Box 2271
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Hey!
======================================
Box 2272
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It was nice working with you,
Pyrus. I hope you find whatever it is
you are looking for.
======================================
Box 2273
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I hope so too, but I know Gahn
will come for me eventually. None of
us can avoid him forever. All I want
is peace and solitude.
======================================
Box 2274
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Go ahead and sit on your tail.
You are all so hopeless.
======================================
Box 2275
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We are hopeless for a reason,
Mi'la. You have yet to discover it.
======================================
Box 2276
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No, I have yet to accept it.
We're still here, Dogerdumb. We
haven't lost yet.
======================================
Box 2277
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We'll see.
======================================
Box 2278
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We'll see and we'll see again and
again and again. When are you going
to wakeup?
======================================
Box 2279
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yeah, when are you going to
wakeup?
======================================
Box 2280
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     \175
======================================
Box 2281
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's go.
======================================
Box 2282
--------------------------------------

     There are those able to look at
your reality and deny its existence.
======================================
Box 2283
--------------------------------------

     Those who accept reality as
controlled and ordered by a higher
power live long, peaceful lives having
no need, want, or care.
======================================
Box 2284
--------------------------------------

     You are beginning to annoy me.
======================================
Box 2285
--------------------------------------

     You have ${V27} days left.
======================================
Box 2286
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Excellent work.
======================================
Box 2287
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     See to it that you handle them
well.
======================================
Box 2288
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I thought you were helping us.
======================================
Box 2289
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Yes, I was.
======================================
Box 2290
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Take them away.
======================================
Box 2291
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Dart!
======================================
Box 2292
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Who is the one running away?
======================================
Box 2293
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I told you not to be a hero.
======================================
Box 2294
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Knock them out.
======================================
Box 2295
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Put them into these barrels and
load them into the ship.
======================================
Box 2296
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Man, this one is really heavy!
======================================
Box 2297
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     I'll take the girl.
======================================
Box 2298
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Don't touch her! I will take care
of her.
======================================
Box 2299
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     There, now see to it that we are
ready to cast off.
======================================
Box 2300
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Aye-aye, captain.
======================================
Box 2301
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I want to be at Cyport's docks
within the day.
======================================
Box 2302
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I cannot allow Gahn to know what
I am doing. He would surely kill me.
======================================
Box 2303
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I know I wouldn't be the first.
======================================
Box 2304
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I don't know if you can hear me
in there, Dogero, but I am taking a
great risk for you. Do not disappoint
me.
======================================
Box 2305
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Gahn wants me to provide support
to his most trusted protector. You
should know to whom I refer.
======================================
Box 2306
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     She has been assigned to the
protectors in Cyport, to save the
fools from their own self-started
destruction.
======================================
Box 2307
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I am not sure if I was right in
siding with him anymore. I thought it
was the only way I stood a chance in\175
======================================
Box 2308
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I don't even remember what it
was that I wanted to do, or what any
of us wanted to do. What is the
greater point to this?
======================================
Box 2309
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I am hoping you will show me.
======================================
Box 2310
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Ha-ha, you slept through
practice, again!
======================================
Box 2311
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No, I haven't been waiting for
you to wakeup. I just happened to be
here.
======================================
Box 2312
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Let's play tag, you'll never
catch me!
======================================
Box 2313
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     You missed practice for today.
You should have woken up sooner. But
it is okay, just be on time tomorrow.
======================================
Box 2314
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     You must learn to make the most
of your day, every moment counts.
======================================
Box 2315
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     I am thankful your elders have
allowed me to stay with you. And I am
honored they would allow me to train
you.
======================================
Box 2316
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Oh boy, am I tired.
======================================
Box 2317
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     I feel so exhausted, but not
worn out. This is a good feeling.
======================================
Box 2318
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     I think I will go to sleep here\175
======================================
Box 2319
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Zzz\175
======================================
Box 2320
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Good to see you, I missed you at
practice today.
======================================
Box 2321
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     It is all about speed! "The
faster you are, the more you can do."
Master told me that.
======================================
Box 2322
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I'm going to be just like the
valorians when I grow up.
======================================
Box 2323
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I lost to Katina and Manx in a
team sparing match today. It was all
my fault too. I am not a team player.
======================================
Box 2324
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I have to do better. I want to
be the best, but I am nothing now.
======================================
Box 2325
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     No, I am not crying. I just have
something in my eye.
======================================
Box 2326
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Hello Dogero, I wish you were
here earlier.
======================================
Box 2327
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     The world is a wonderful place.
I wish I could travel it as much as
Master has.
======================================
Box 2328
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Today he told us that we'll
become the protectors of this world
someday. It will take a lot of
sacrifice though.
======================================
Box 2329
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     We will be selfless, tireless,
caring, receiving no reward or gain
in giving a voice to those who have
none\175
======================================
Box 2330
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Except the reward of knowing we
have done a good thing.
======================================
Box 2331
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I can't wait!
======================================
Box 2332
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Can you?
======================================
Box 2333
--------------------------------------

     I'm not touching him.
======================================
Box 2334
--------------------------------------

     He appears as if he were dead.
======================================
Box 2335
--------------------------------------

     You weaklings, watch this, he
won't bite.
======================================
Box 2336
--------------------------------------

     Wakeup, you fool sleepyhead!
======================================
Box 2337
--------------------------------------

     Yikes, he almost took your head
off.
======================================
Box 2338
--------------------------------------

     It worked; he seems to be able
to move now.
======================================
Box 2339
--------------------------------------

     Let's bring him above deck.
======================================
Box 2340
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Where are we?
======================================
Box 2341
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     We have no idea.
======================================
Box 2342
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Hmm\175
======================================
Box 2343
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Do you think it is safe to leave
ship?
======================================
Box 2344
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     There's only one way to find out.
We really don't have a choice.
======================================
Box 2345
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Dogero!
======================================
Box 2346
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I mean, uh\175 I'm a bit tired.
======================================
Box 2347
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You are insufferable.
======================================
Box 2348
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Johan, you be leader. Dogero is
not capable of being such.
======================================
Box 2349
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Why don't you? You're the one
barking out orders.
======================================
Box 2350
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I do not bark!
======================================
Box 2351
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     We are wasting time. Our best
option is to go into town and find
our bearings. Agreed?
======================================
Box 2352
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Agreed.
======================================
Box 2353
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Agreed.
======================================
Box 2354
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Mi'la?
======================================
Box 2355
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     When will you wakeup?
======================================
Box 2356
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's go.
======================================
Box 2357
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I don't think I will find any
desert clothes out there.
======================================
Box 2358
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     It's fresh. There's probably a
jelleclop monster nearby, be careful.
======================================
Box 2359
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Strange, what is jelleclop slime
doing here?
======================================
Box 2360
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Slime, yuck\175 The last thing
I want to do is have to fight a
jelleclop monster.
======================================
Box 2361
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Jelleclop slime\175 I have a bad
feeling about this.
======================================
Box 2362
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     I'll send Whisper to report our
progress.
======================================
Box 2363
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It's good to see you again.
======================================
Box 2364
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You know this thing?
======================================
Box 2365
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It is not a thing, it is a she.
Anon helped me during my days as a
protector.
======================================
Box 2366
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     Don't hang around where you don't
belong.
======================================
Box 2367
--------------------------------------
[\223 ????]
     Get lost.
======================================
Box 2368
--------------------------------------
[\212 ????]
     I'm feeling pretty tired; we
should visit the inn later, ha-ha-ha!
======================================
Box 2369
--------------------------------------
[\212 ????]
     Ha-ha-ha, look at her squirm.
======================================
Box 2370
--------------------------------------
[\223 ????]
     This is too easy{}Fralin doesn't
even have a protector.
======================================
Box 2371
--------------------------------------
[\220 Innkeeper]
     Help me!
======================================
Box 2372
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     I suggest you bugger off.
======================================
Box 2373
--------------------------------------
======================================
Box 2374
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     I said get the hell out of here
if you know what's good for you!
======================================
Box 2375
--------------------------------------
[\223 ????]
     Hah, I guess he wants to die.
======================================
Box 2376
--------------------------------------
[\223 ????]
     Hah, I guess they want to die.
======================================
Box 2377
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     Let's take 'em out.
======================================
Box 2378
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Are you okay?
======================================
Box 2379
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We took them out, nothing to
worry about now.
======================================
Box 2380
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You alright?
======================================
Box 2381
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     It is over. There is nothing to
fear any longer.
======================================
Box 2382
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     How could they\175 how could anyone\175
======================================
Box 2383
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     Please, stay with me for a while.
I don't want to be alone.
======================================
Box 2384
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     Thank you. I am feeling better
now.
======================================
Box 2385
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     I am glad to see there are still
good people left in the land. Maybe
we aren't doomed after all.
======================================
Box 2386
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Maybe.
======================================
Box 2387
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We were never doomed. At least
none of us who choose to live are.
======================================
Box 2388
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What do you mean? When were we
ever doomed?
======================================
Box 2389
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     I don't know what I mean\175 it is
just the wolf monster scare and such\175
======================================
Box 2390
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     There are a lot of evil people,
yes. But that is no reason not to
fight them.
======================================
Box 2391
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     If you ever feel weary, you are
welcome to stay here free of charge.
It is the least I can do in return.
======================================
Box 2392
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Thank you.
======================================
Box 2393
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Noted.
======================================
Box 2394
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Thanks!

[\203 Pyrus]

[\209 Innkeeper]
     Welcome back.
======================================
Box 2400
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     Do you need a room? Only 1$ a
day.
======================================
Box 2401
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes.
======================================
Box 2402
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Yes.
======================================
Box 2403
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yep.
======================================
Box 2404
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Yes, we do.
======================================
Box 2405
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     You don't have any bits! Come
back when you get some.
======================================
Box 2406
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     Great, the room upstairs is all
yours. If you need anything, I'll be
down here.
======================================
Box 2407
--------------------------------------
             - Spent 1$ -
======================================
Box 2408
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     Was everything okay?
======================================
Box 2409
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes, I had a good sleep.
======================================
Box 2410
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     You better not have destroyed
another bed!
======================================
Box 2411
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It was fine.
======================================
Box 2412
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     Good to hear; please come again
when you are tired.
======================================
Box 2413
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     It was great, except for the huge
bedbug beneath my pillow that almost
killed me.
======================================
Box 2414
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     What!
======================================
Box 2415
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Just kidding.
======================================
Box 2416
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Everything was fine, thank you.
======================================
Box 2417
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     Feel free to come back anytime
you like.
======================================
Box 2418
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No.
======================================
Box 2419
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Nope.
======================================
Box 2420
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Not today.
======================================
Box 2421
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     No thank you.
======================================
Box 2422
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     Come back when you do.
======================================
Box 2423
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     Do you need a room?
======================================
Box 2424
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     It's all yours. Enjoy your stay.
======================================
Box 2425
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     Thank you for saving me.
======================================
Box 2426
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     Wait, wait, who are you?
======================================
Box 2427
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I am{}
======================================
Box 2428
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     What-what-what! What are you
doing here?
======================================
Box 2429
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I don't{}
======================================
Box 2430
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     Someone, quick! Call the
protectors, we have intruders!
======================================
Box 2431
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     To hell with this.
======================================
Box 2432
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I do not believe we will have to
resort to violence.
======================================
Box 2433
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Did I say I was going to? No!
======================================
Box 2434
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     From the looks of it, I think we
might be in Cyport. I have heard it
is a very active place and almost as
big as Keltan.
======================================
Box 2435
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Be on guard, here come the town's
protectors.
======================================
Box 2436
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     You look like a new face. State
your name and business in Cyport.
======================================
Box 2437
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     My name is Dogero, and{}
======================================
Box 2438
--------------------------------------
[\225 ????]
     He's Dogero!
======================================
Box 2439
--------------------------------------
[\212 ????]
     How did he get in?
======================================
Box 2440
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     If you people would let me finish
one of my sentences, I will tell you.
======================================
Box 2441
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     Come with us, anyone who comes in
must be escorted to the town hall. We
are under a lockdown.
======================================
Box 2442
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What happened?
======================================
Box 2443
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     Monsters, a lot of them. We were
unable to keep them back efficiently\175
======================================
Box 2444
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     We lost many good protectors.
======================================
Box 2445
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     Gahn has sent his best to aid
us in our time of need. I hope she is
enough, but I am doubtful.
======================================
Box 2446
--------------------------------------
[\225 ????]
     Things are looking up now that
Dogero is here, I am sure we can
stand a chance. Was he supposed to be
coming?
======================================
Box 2447
--------------------------------------
[\212 ????]
     I didn't hear it if he was. They
all look like they can fight. I am
sure they will help us once we take
them to town hall.
======================================
Box 2448
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     Alright, this way to the hall.
Follow us.
======================================
Box 2449
--------------------------------------
[\225 ????]
     I would like to make sure you
are aware of the general state of
things before you enter.
======================================
Box 2450
--------------------------------------
[\225 ????]
     But first, let me introduce you
to the protectors of Cyport!
======================================
Box 2451
--------------------------------------
[\225 ????]
     This is Spunk, our best fighter
and enforcer of laws.
======================================
Box 2452
--------------------------------------
[\230 Spunk]
     It is a honor to finally meet
you, Dogero.
======================================
Box 2453
--------------------------------------
[\225 ????]
     This is Plug, the smart one in
our group.
======================================
Box 2454
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     I don't consider myself too
smart, but I do like to think from
time to time.
======================================
Box 2455
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You have to be kidding me.
======================================
Box 2456
--------------------------------------
[\225 ????]
     And this lovely couple behind me
is Kocyte and Leu.
======================================
Box 2457
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Who are you?
======================================
Box 2458
--------------------------------------
[\225 ????]
     I am Keel, your humble servant
and former overseer of the bunch.
======================================
Box 2459
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     I do not hold a grudge, if that
is what you may think. I really don't
mind, it isn't like a demotion,
really.
======================================
Box 2460
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     The new overseer is\175 easy to
upset. Do not interrupt her, answer
her questions as briefly as possible,
be on your best behavior\175
======================================
Box 2461
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     I am sure you know how to handle
yourself properly, so I will move on.
======================================
Box 2462
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     As you know, we are in a
lockdown, that is, we have walled
off our town and have locked the
gates.
======================================
Box 2463
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     No one comes in or out, save for
by ship. That is the only means we
have to supply ourselves from the
outside.
======================================
Box 2464
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     The monsters come primarily from
the east, we believe from somewhere
near the Rorc Mountains.
======================================
Box 2465
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     At first we could handle
ourselves, but the monsters changed.
They began to be less animal like and
more like us.
======================================
Box 2466
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     We can hardly tell the difference
anymore, which is why everyone who
comes in must have an interview with
our overseer.
======================================
Box 2467
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     Do you have any questions before
you enter?
======================================
Box 2468
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     What is it that you would like
to know?
======================================
Box 2469
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Who is the overseer?
======================================
Box 2470
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     She is Katina Lee, sent to us in
our darkest hour by Gahn himself. He
has answered our deepest desires.
======================================
Box 2471
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     She is very irritable, and
rightly so at our failure to
adequately protect Cyport. Once she
came, the monster attacks died down.
======================================
Box 2472
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     She has the best interest of the
people at heart, and that is all that
counts. She can really do no wrong
and we are thankful for her help.
======================================
Box 2473
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What have you done about the
source of the problem, the Rorc
Mountains?
======================================
Box 2474
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     We were planning an attack on it
but luckily our current overseer
showed up and stopped us.
======================================
Box 2475
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     We have to protect the people
here, we cannot leave them.
======================================
Box 2476
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     We are in a tight spot. On one
side we could fight back but on the
other we must tend to the people's
needs.
======================================
Box 2477
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     Any other questions?
======================================
Box 2478
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     Any other questions?
======================================
Box 2479
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     I think that is enough for now,
she will take care of the rest. You
may enter.
======================================
Box 2480
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No.
======================================
Box 2481
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     Then you may enter.
======================================
Box 2482
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let me do the talking.
======================================
Box 2483
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Are you sure you can handle this?
======================================
Box 2484
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I know I can.
======================================
Box 2485
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     We'll be right behind you.
======================================
Box 2486
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Do not forget us if you require
assistance.
======================================
Box 2487
--------------------------------------
[\225 ????]
     They perform a lot of the less
glorious work, but that doesn't make
them any less valuable than the rest
of us.
======================================
Box 2488
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Do not give up, no matter what
happens. If you cannot overcome her,
do not be afraid to make use of the
resources available to you: us.
======================================
Box 2489
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     So you are now resources for me
to manipulate?
======================================
Box 2490
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Yes, we are your allies.
======================================
Box 2491
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We want you to succeed. If you
succeed, we do, because we have all
chosen the same side.
======================================
Box 2492
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Alright, let's do this.
======================================
Box 2493
--------------------------------------
     Once Katina displays text:

Press UP to respond,
USE KEY not to respond,
LEFT to signal Pyrus to respond,
DOWN to signal Johan to respond,
and RIGHT to signal Mi'la to respond.
======================================
Box 2494
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Do not talk to me like that!
======================================
Box 2495
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Shutup, I am in control here!
======================================
Box 2496
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Do not anger me!
======================================
Box 2497
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     You are getting on my nerves{}
do not push me any further.
======================================
Box 2498
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     That is it, I have had it with
you. Kill them!
======================================
Box 2499
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Dogero! And Mi'la! How dare a
bunch of failed protectors enter my
town!
======================================
Box 2500
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Hear us out before you dismiss
us. I thought you were non-judgmental
and open-minded, Katina.
======================================
Box 2501
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I still am, just not when it
comes to the likes of you and what you
stand for!
======================================
Box 2502
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We were never protectors like
you, get it straight.
======================================
Box 2503
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     You weren't because you couldn't
cut it, you were not even humble
enough to show up for the majority of
our training!
======================================
Box 2504
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     When did this town become yours?
======================================
Box 2505
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Gahn gave you this town, and he
stole it away from those living in it.
======================================
Box 2506
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     You have no right to be here,
you have no right at all.
======================================
Box 2507
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     If all you are going to do is
accuse us without reasoning, then we
will leave.
======================================
Box 2508
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     You're not going anywhere!
======================================
Box 2509
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Says you!
======================================
Box 2510
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     We have every right as you do!
======================================
Box 2511
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     And where is your right?
======================================
Box 2512
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Give me one good reason why I
shouldn't have you kicked out of town.
======================================
Box 2513
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Why shouldn't I have you thrown
out? Tell me!
======================================
Box 2514
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We aren't here to hurt anyone.
======================================
Box 2515
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     It is too late for that! Your
very presence has shown our walls can
be breached. You have hurt our morale.
======================================
Box 2516
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Give me one good reason why we
shouldn't kick you out of town.
======================================
Box 2517
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I don't think any reason we give
will satisfy you.
======================================
Box 2518
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I once was in the same position
you were in. My town, New Keltan, was
under assault by raiders when these
three came.
======================================
Box 2519
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     They assisted me in removing
those who would do the town harm. As
a fellow protector, you must trust me.
======================================
Box 2520
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     You're no protector. I have heard
about you, Pyrus. You ran away from
your duty! You are not to be trusted.
======================================
Box 2521
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     The protectors of Cyport were
too inflexible before I showed up.
This town has me to thank for its
current success.
======================================
Box 2522
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You are in a lockdown and you
call it success?
======================================
Box 2523
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You call this success?
======================================
Box 2524
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You're caught up in the needs of
the people, that doesn't solve
anything. Believe me, I've been there.
======================================
Box 2525
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Gahn has perverted what it means
to be a protector. What you have done
is not protecting, but weakening.
======================================
Box 2526
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I have done away with the old,
out-dated rules and have brought in
the new. Times are harder, and people
must bear it.
======================================
Box 2527
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Katina\175 what have you done?
======================================
Box 2528
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     People shouldn't have to bear
suffering!
======================================
Box 2529
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Just because something is new
doesn't mean it is better.
======================================
Box 2530
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You have done nothing to solve
the problem, you have merely delayed
it with your lockdown.
======================================
Box 2531
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Why haven't you come to Cyport's
aid sooner? Why shouldn't I force you
to assist the people in their time of
need?
======================================
Box 2532
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Give me a reason why I should not
force you to help us!
======================================
Box 2533
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We didn't know Cyport was in
trouble.
======================================
Box 2534
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     That's no excuse!
======================================
Box 2535
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Do not force us. If you do, you
will be oppressing us. Isn't that
something you despise?
======================================
Box 2536
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     But it is justified!
======================================
Box 2537
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Why is it justified? For the
greater good? When you believe in that
nonsense you become tyrannical and
arbitrary{}things you hate, right?
======================================
Box 2538
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Acting on the greater good's
behalf doesn't lead to that{}and how
would you know? You've never done
anything for anyone but yourself!
======================================
Box 2539
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Why would you need our help if
you are doing such a great job?
======================================
Box 2540
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Do not mock me!
======================================
Box 2541
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     That is not how you solve
problems.
======================================
Box 2542
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Yes it is! We must all work
together.
======================================
Box 2543
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     You do not care about the people
of Cyport. I do. I care more about
them than you could ever dream, more
than you care about yourself.
======================================
Box 2544
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Are we not equally deserving of
your care?
======================================
Box 2545
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Why do you think I am talking to
you right now?
======================================
Box 2546
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     That is horrible.
======================================
Box 2547
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I doubt that. Everything I do is
for my own gain, beat that caring!
======================================
Box 2548
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     If you care for them, then set
them free.
======================================
Box 2549
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     They are free! They weren't free
before I came. I'm the one fighting
for freedom, not you!
======================================
Box 2550
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I show I care by doing something.
This town doesn't need heroes, we need
the practical and attainable, which
is what I have given them.
======================================
Box 2551
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Being a protector used to mean
being a hero. What happened to you,
Katina?
======================================
Box 2552
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     What happened to me? I realized
how hurtful the world is and grew up.
When will you?
======================================
Box 2553
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Heroism is practical and
attainable, fool.
======================================
Box 2554
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     It is not! We don't need it, it
leads to even more suffering.
======================================
Box 2555
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     How is this caring? This is
mindlessness!
======================================
Box 2556
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You have taken their freedom,
and have given them dependence in its
place.
======================================
Box 2557
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     What would you do in my position?
======================================
Box 2558
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Answer me! What would you do?
======================================
Box 2559
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I am not sure I would ever
willingly be in your position.
======================================
Box 2560
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Because you are a failure and a
coward!
======================================
Box 2561
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Nothing that I'm not doing now.
======================================
Box 2562
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     That doesn't help anyone!
======================================
Box 2563
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     The opposite of what you are
doing. You cannot solve anything by
feeding the needs of others{}you have
to fight the problem head-on!
======================================
Box 2564
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I can't, it isn't that simple or
easy. I can't\175
======================================
Box 2565
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I would seek out the source of
the trouble.
======================================
Box 2566
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     That is not practical!
======================================
Box 2567
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Why am I even listening to you?
You are to cause for all of this.
======================================
Box 2568
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You are making this into
something it isn't.
======================================
Box 2569
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We are not, you are!
======================================
Box 2570
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     You're so childish, Mi'la.
======================================
Box 2571
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Don't blame us for something we
had no part in.
======================================
Box 2572
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     We have had no part in this
until we found ourselves in Cyport
by boat.
======================================
Box 2573
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     You never really cared about
anyone but yourself, only your selfish
interest, your own gain. That makes
you no different from monsters.
======================================
Box 2574
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You don't mean that, Katina.
======================================
Box 2575
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Don't tell me what I mean!
======================================
Box 2576
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     So what, we're monsters to the
irrational. What's your point?
======================================
Box 2577
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Just because I care about myself
doesn't mean I don't care about
anyone else. Your reasoning is flawed.
======================================
Box 2578
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     We are not monsters.
======================================
Box 2579
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     You sure look like one to me!
======================================
Box 2580
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Your reasoning, your values{}
all of it is wrong. You make me sick.
Accept you are wrong and I will let
you leave.
======================================
Box 2581
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Accept you are wrong!
======================================
Box 2582
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Are you too self-important to
answer me? You're no better than any
of us!
======================================
Box 2583
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Do not ignore me{}answer me!
======================================
Box 2584
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No.
======================================
Box 2585
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Never.
======================================
Box 2586
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I will not accept what is not
true.
======================================
Box 2587
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I have nothing to say to her.
======================================
Box 2588
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     You infuriate me, I cannot
believe what you have become, you
especially, Dogero. I am tired of
arguing.
======================================
Box 2589
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     So am I.
======================================
Box 2590
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You disgust me too, Katina.
======================================
Box 2591
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     There is nothing wrong with who
Dogero is!
======================================
Box 2592
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     And I am tired of protectors like
you.
======================================
Box 2593
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     The people of this town love me,
not you. And that is all I need to
prove I am right and you are wrong.
======================================
Box 2594
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     That has nothing to do with this.
======================================
Box 2595
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Their love is misplaced.
======================================
Box 2596
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     That proves nothing. This isn't
a popularity contest!
======================================
Box 2597
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Why do they love you, have you
ever asked them? They do not have a
choice, you are their protector by
force.
======================================
Box 2598
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Are you going to help us or not?
======================================
Box 2599
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It is none of your business if
I am or not.
======================================
Box 2600
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     As a protector, it is my business
to know.
======================================
Box 2601
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Maybe if it is worth our while.
======================================
Box 2602
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     You're no heroes, you're swords
for hire. How disgusting to profit
from the misfortune of others.
======================================
Box 2603
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     That is for us to decide. We will
tell you when we have chosen our best
option.
======================================
Box 2604
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     The people of this city are our
best option.
======================================
Box 2605
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Listen carefully to me, Katina,
if you value your life you will listen
with all that is left in your being.
======================================
Box 2606
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Great intentions do not translate
into great actions. You can care until
there is nothing left to care for.
When will you have cared enough?
======================================
Box 2607
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Do not damn us for valuing our
own lives. I once valued your life
above others and you responded in
anger.
======================================
Box 2608
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     People are not equal in the sense
you would have it mean, some I hold
above others. I will never care more
about strangers than those I esteem.
======================================
Box 2609
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     People should be equal! It is
not fair for some to be better than
others; no one should be worse off
than the next person!
======================================
Box 2610
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You see reality as cold and
unforgiving, something cruel and
oppressive where the meek suffer
and evil prevails more often than not.
======================================
Box 2611
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     It is! Why can't you accept that?
It has to change{}I will fight it!
======================================
Box 2612
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Do not force me into slavery
because you are unwilling to support
yourself.
======================================
Box 2613
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     It isn't about me not being able
to support myself, it is about doing
what's best for everyone.
======================================
Box 2614
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It is clear that I cannot change
your mind and you cannot change mine.
Therefore, it is now up to reality,
cold and unforgiving.
======================================
Box 2615
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I will solve Cyport's problems,
so that the lockdown may be lifted,
and I may leave. Once I do, I will
return and give you one final chance.
======================================
Box 2616
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     You're not my overseer, Gahn is.
Don't talk to me like that!
======================================
Box 2617
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Try and stop me at your own risk.
======================================
Box 2618
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I didn't say you could leave!
======================================
Box 2619
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Where do you think you are going?
======================================
Box 2620
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Do not ignore me!
======================================
Box 2621
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You really let her have it back
there!
======================================
Box 2622
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     How can we save Cyport if the
threat is beyond the walls?
======================================
Box 2623
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We will free it from the inside.
======================================
Box 2624
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     We can not do that, you know what
she has turned this place into.
======================================
Box 2625
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Are you with us or against us?
======================================
Box 2626
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I am with you.
======================================
Box 2627
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Then do not doubt our resolve;
when you do, it shows you doubt your
own.
======================================
Box 2628
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     We can do this, we have to. It
won't be the first time we've fixed
Gahn's mess.
======================================
Box 2629
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What's wrong?
======================================
Box 2630
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I have passed through here
before, not too long ago.
======================================
Box 2631
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     And?
======================================
Box 2632
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     This city was more than I could
take in at the time. I was a wanderer,
lost, and being in this city
overwhelmed me.
======================================
Box 2633
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It reminded me in a very direct
manner that I failed; it seemed so
alive and I felt so out of place.
======================================
Box 2634
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You never failed.
======================================
Box 2635
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I did. I could have stopped all
of this. I had a chance to defeat the
source. I'll never have another chance
like that.
======================================
Box 2636
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I had a brief surge of hope in
the heat of arguing with Katina and
lost my bearings. I don't think we
can do this.
======================================
Box 2637
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We will. There is no reason to
give up and die, now's the time to
fight!
======================================
Box 2638
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     If Gahn can ruin this town, this
town that felt like walking through
fire not too long ago\175 then we never
had a chance.
======================================
Box 2639
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh shutup!
======================================
Box 2640
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You haven't realized why you are
depressed yet? The source of your
depression wasn't that you failed{}
you never failed!
======================================
Box 2641
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     The only thing you failed at was
becoming someone like Katina.
======================================
Box 2642
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Instead, you chose to become
yourself, not whoever Gahn had wanted
you to be.
======================================
Box 2643
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You have nothing to be ashamed
of. None of us do.
======================================
Box 2644
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Thanks, Mi'la.
======================================
Box 2645
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Don't thank me! We don't have
time for this!
======================================
Box 2646
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     All right. Let's do our best.
======================================
Box 2647
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     No regrets.
======================================
Box 2648
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No regrets.
======================================
Box 2649
--------------------------------------
[\209 ????]
     I can't keep allowing everyone
the use of my facilities, it isn't
right.
======================================
Box 2650
--------------------------------------
[\209 ????]
     I am servicing my competition
for free! All because of the new
fairness in business law. I fail to
see the fairness in this.
======================================
Box 2651
--------------------------------------
[\209 ????]
     You look like you can hold your
own in a fight. I have a proposition
for you if you would be interested in
hearing it.
======================================
Box 2652
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No, I do not want to hear your
proposition.
======================================
Box 2653
--------------------------------------
[\209 ????]
     Come back when you change your
mind. Hang around the port long enough
and you'll see. You'll see\175
======================================
Box 2654
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What do you have in mind?
======================================
Box 2655
--------------------------------------
[\209 ????]
     Here's the deal: I will pay you
80$ for your services as hired hands.
======================================
Box 2656
--------------------------------------
[\209 ????]
     If you can keep my area clean of
thieves for a day, I should be able
to make enough to stay in business.
======================================
Box 2657
--------------------------------------
[\209 ????]
     It won't be easy, a brainwashed
protector is the enforcer of the so
called fairness. He is nice, but
misguided ever since Katina came.
======================================
Box 2658
--------------------------------------
[\209 ????]
     He'll likely try to muscle you
out of here.
======================================
Box 2659
--------------------------------------
[\209 ????]
     If I cannot turn a profit soon,
I'm going to give this up. It isn't
worth my time as it stands now. I am
not going to operate at a loss.
======================================
Box 2660
--------------------------------------
[\209 ????]
     Are my terms acceptable or do
you need more time to think it over?
======================================
Box 2661
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We are not ready.
======================================
Box 2662
--------------------------------------
[\209 ????]
     Come back when you are.
======================================
Box 2663
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Your terms are acceptable.
======================================
Box 2664
--------------------------------------
[\209 ????]
     Good, you may begin by getting
rid of everyone here. None of them
work for me.
======================================
Box 2665
--------------------------------------
[\209 ????]
     Oh, and by the way, the name's
Stapler.
======================================
Box 2666
--------------------------------------
[\209 Stapler]
     Get the thieves out of my place.
======================================
Box 2667
--------------------------------------
[\209 Stapler]
     Good work, now help me get all
these boxes in order for shipping.
======================================
Box 2668
--------------------------------------
[\209 Stapler]
     The ship should dock anytime now.
======================================
Box 2669
--------------------------------------
[\209 Stapler]
     Thugs, they're on to us.
======================================
Box 2670
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     You are in violation of the
fairness act!
======================================
Box 2671
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     Let others use your facility,
it is the biggest and best one here.
======================================
Box 2672
--------------------------------------
[\209 Stapler]
     Over my dead body!
======================================
Box 2673
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     We are not here to kill you; we
are doing this in everyone's best
interest.
======================================
Box 2674
--------------------------------------
[\209 Stapler]
     Do it somewhere else.
======================================
Box 2675
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     You leave us no choice, we must
force you to cooperate.
======================================
Box 2676
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     Tell your goons to stand down.
======================================
Box 2677
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No.
======================================
Box 2678
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     What did you say!
======================================
Box 2679
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     If you are here to push us around
in the name of fairness, then hurry
up and use your force or get the hell
out of here.
======================================
Box 2680
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     If you want to bring this to such
a base level, then we will comply.
Know you brought this on yourself, it
isn't our fault if you get hurt.
======================================
Box 2681
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Your resolve is weak.
======================================
Box 2682
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yeah, I wouldn't worry about us
getting hurt, if I were you.
======================================
Box 2683
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     Prepare yourselves!
======================================
Box 2684
--------------------------------------
[\209 Stapler]
     Good, good, now help me load the
ship with my cargo.
======================================
Box 2685
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     What do you mean they're breaking
the law? Can't you stop them?
======================================
Box 2686
--------------------------------------
[\230 Spunk]
     I sent some people to stop them,
but they failed.
======================================
Box 2687
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     How can you hope to be a great
protector if you can't even enforce
fairness?
======================================
Box 2688
--------------------------------------
[\230 Spunk]
     I am sorry, I will do better.
======================================
Box 2689
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     No, you'll go down there yourself
and make it happen!
======================================
Box 2690
--------------------------------------
[\230 Spunk]
     Yes, understood.
======================================
Box 2691
--------------------------------------
[\209 Stapler]
     One last thing to do, we have to
take inventory and sort out what the
shippers had for me.
======================================
Box 2692
--------------------------------------
[\230 Spunk]
     Stapler! What do you think you
are doing?
======================================
Box 2693
--------------------------------------
[\230 Spunk]
     Where is everyone else? Why
aren't you allowing them to work with
you?
======================================
Box 2694
--------------------------------------
[\209 Stapler]
     I am not running a charity.
======================================
Box 2695
--------------------------------------
[\230 Spunk]
     Dogero, why are you helping him
break the law?
======================================
Box 2696
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Your law is based on a false
hope, it helps no one.
======================================
Box 2697
--------------------------------------
[\230 Spunk]
     How can you say that? When we get
rid of competition and make business
fair, everyone benefits.
======================================
Box 2698
--------------------------------------
[\209 Stapler]
     This law is putting me out of
business.
======================================
Box 2699
--------------------------------------
[\230 Spunk]
     I was\175 unaware of it.
======================================
Box 2700
--------------------------------------
[\209 Stapler]
     I am the only competent person
left working the docks, the rest have
already quit if you haven't noticed.
======================================
Box 2701
--------------------------------------
[\230 Spunk]
     But how can fairness be a bad
thing?
======================================
Box 2702
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You fail in assuming that your
fairness law is fair.
======================================
Box 2703
--------------------------------------
[\230 Spunk]
     We didn't want anyone to have an
unfair advantage over anyone else, we
thought it would promote\175
======================================
Box 2704
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Promote what?
======================================
Box 2705
--------------------------------------
[\230 Spunk]
     I am not sure anymore.
======================================
Box 2706
--------------------------------------
[\230 Spunk]
     I am not sure about anything
anymore\175 I need some time alone,
please excuse me.
======================================
Box 2707
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Losing faith is easy when your
only friend is Gahn.
======================================
Box 2708
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What was it supposed to promote?
======================================
Box 2709
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Unity.
======================================
Box 2710
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     He ran away because of that? I
don't get it.
======================================
Box 2711
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Most protectors do not get it
either.
======================================
Box 2712
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     How about that pay?
======================================
Box 2713
--------------------------------------
[\209 Stapler]
     Here you go, you earned every bit
of it.
======================================
Box 2714
--------------------------------------
           \169 Received 80$ \169
======================================
Box 2715
--------------------------------------
[\209 Stapler]
     Things are looking up in Cyport.
Thank you.
======================================
Box 2716
--------------------------------------
[\205 ????]
     Bah! They wanted me to work for
free, the fools. They are ruining this
town.
======================================
Box 2717
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Who are they?
======================================
Box 2718
--------------------------------------
[\205 ????]
     The protectors. Katina is the
worst one. Things weren't as bad
before she showed up.
======================================
Box 2719
--------------------------------------
[\205 ????]
     I used to run a school here, but
she took it away from me. Katina
replaced me with Plug.
======================================
Box 2720
--------------------------------------
[\205 ????]
     She thought school should be free
and mandatory for \185our future', the
children. As if when one becomes an
adult, one no longer has a future.
======================================
Box 2721
--------------------------------------
[\205 ????]
     Bah, just go see what it has
become yourself, then tell me she was
right for forcing me onto the street.
That school is mine!
======================================
Box 2722
--------------------------------------
[\205 ????]
     Go see what my school has become,
and tell me everything is for the
better.
======================================
Box 2723
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We have already visited it.
======================================
Box 2724
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     Hello Dogero, and company.
======================================
Box 2725
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Hello.
======================================
Box 2726
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     It is nice for you to visit my
classroom but I must ask you to leave.
It is hard enough to conduct class
as it is.
======================================
Box 2727
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What is the problem?
======================================
Box 2728
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     I don't know exactly. The
previous instructor never had this
problem; I was one of his pupils once,
so I should know.
======================================
Box 2729
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     The children have short attention
spans, they won't sit still, they have
too much energy, they are too\175
======================================
Box 2730
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Too much like normal children?
======================================
Box 2731
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     No, I mean, it isn't supposed to
be like this.
======================================
Box 2732
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     I feel like giving up\175 but I
can't. Someone has to do this, it is
a noble profession. I care about the
children too much to quit.
======================================
Box 2733
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Your feelings say otherwise.
======================================
Box 2734
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Excuse her.
======================================
Box 2735
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     What am I to do\175
======================================
Box 2736
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     Class, class! May I have your
attention, please\175
======================================
Box 2737
--------------------------------------
[\205 ????]
     So you visited my school? What
did you think of its current state?
======================================
Box 2738
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It was okay, not perfect but
okay.
======================================
Box 2739
--------------------------------------
[\205 ????]
     Bah! You call that okay? Go take
another look!
======================================
Box 2740
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It was awful.
======================================
Box 2741
--------------------------------------
[\205 ????]
     Yes, and there's not a damn thing
I can do about it.
======================================
Box 2742
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Would you be willing to go back
to work?
======================================
Box 2743
--------------------------------------
[\205 ????]
     If I was allowed to run my school
however I want.
======================================
Box 2744
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     How much were you paid?
======================================
Box 2745
--------------------------------------
[\205 ????]
     I was paid by whichever parents
wanted me to tutor their children.
======================================
Box 2746
--------------------------------------
[\205 ????]
     Look, let's cut to the chase,
will you help me get my school back
or not?
======================================
Box 2747
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes, how will we go about it?
======================================
Box 2748
--------------------------------------
[\205 ????]
     Meet me at my school at noon.
We'll go from there.
======================================
Box 2749
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No, not right now.
======================================
Box 2750
--------------------------------------
[\205 ????]
     Bah!
======================================
Box 2751
--------------------------------------
[\205 ????]
     Glad you could make it.
======================================
Box 2752
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What is the plan?
======================================
Box 2753
--------------------------------------
[\205 ????]
     You are going to kick Plug out
of there.
======================================
Box 2754
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Isn't that a bit drastic?
======================================
Box 2755
--------------------------------------
[\205 ????]
     Do you have a better idea?
======================================
Box 2756
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's just enter and work from
there.
======================================
Box 2757
--------------------------------------
[\205 ????]
     Fine, it will be uncomfortable
either way.
======================================
Box 2758
--------------------------------------
[\205 ????]
     Plug, I have come to take my
school back!
======================================
Box 2759
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     Gruff, what a pleasant surprise\175
I thought you'd never come back.
======================================
Box 2760
--------------------------------------
[\205 Gruff]
     Come back?
======================================
Box 2761
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     I have been looking for you\175
======================================
Box 2762
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     I can't handle this. I can only
fool myself for so long. This isn't
working out. I don't care what Katina
says about it.
======================================
Box 2763
--------------------------------------
[\205 Gruff]
     Ah, I see\175
======================================
Box 2764
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     You are the smartest man I know,
and it would be a crime to keep you
from your school.
======================================
Box 2765
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     It is yours, take it. It never
really belonged to me in the first
place.
======================================
Box 2766
--------------------------------------
[\205 Gruff]
     And what about you? What are you
going to do?
======================================
Box 2767
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     Me? At the moment I don't really
know. Anything should be better than
this.
======================================
Box 2768
--------------------------------------
[\205 Gruff]
     Of all the years I have been your
tutor and friend, I find that very
difficult to believe.
======================================
Box 2769
--------------------------------------
[\205 Gruff]
     You were my best pupil. No other
child I have taught had such a thirst
and drive to succeed. Are you no
longer that child?
======================================
Box 2770
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     I haven't been that child for a
long time. I changed when I became
a protector.
======================================
Box 2771
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     I don't want to be a protector
anymore, I want to be myself again.
======================================
Box 2772
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     Farewell.
======================================
Box 2773
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Well, it looks like you got your
school back, and without a fight!
======================================
Box 2774
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     The protectors of Cyport have
weak resolves.
======================================
Box 2775
--------------------------------------
[\205 Gruff]
     No, it is because they have a
strong resolve that they are weak as
protectors.
======================================
Box 2776
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Perhaps.
======================================
Box 2777
--------------------------------------
[\205 Gruff]
     Thank you for helping me, here,
take this icon. It is a rare one I
have held onto, waiting for the right
person to give it to.
======================================
Box 2778
--------------------------------------
[\205 Gruff]
     It is easy for me to see that you
are what the protectors failed to
become. I hope you succeed in your
quest.
======================================
Box 2779
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You don't even know what our
quest is!
======================================
Box 2780
--------------------------------------
[\205 Gruff]
     Ha-ha, but I can tell you have a
good one by what you have done for me.

[\205 Gruff]
     Thank you. Time for me to get
back to work, you should do the same.
======================================
Box 2783
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Yes?
======================================
Box 2784
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     What's wrong? Why are you staring
at me like that?
======================================
Box 2785
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     I am going to the mountains in
exile.
======================================
Box 2786
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     You can't do that, we need you!
======================================
Box 2787
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     I have made up my mind. I am no
protector.
======================================

[\212 Katina]
     The mountains are where the
monsters are coming from, they might
kill you!

     Dogero\175 he must be the cause of
all of this.

[\212 Katina]
     I have to do something.
======================================
Box 2793
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     What can I do?
======================================
Box 2794
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     How could I have ever loved
someone like him? I was a stupid kid,
too young to understand things.

cannot doubt myself. I am right,
I have to be right.

to quit. I want to curl up and die.

     I always wanted to be a somebody,
but\175
======================================
Box 2799
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     This isn't what was supposed to
happen.
======================================
Box 2800
--------------------------------------
[\205 Gruff]
     I suspect Plug isn't the only one
doubting what they have become.
======================================
Box 2801
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     Hello, hello! Welcome to my
visual art studio.
======================================
Box 2802
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     I know these are difficult times,
and now that Katina has taken charge,
I really don't have much to do.
======================================
Box 2803
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     So I thought it nice if I started
this place to boost everyone's
spirits!
======================================
Box 2804
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     People's spirits can be boosted
with this garbage?
======================================
Box 2805
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     It may look like garbage to you,
but to the creator it is priceless.
There's nothing like expressing
oneself to get into the right mood.
======================================
Box 2806
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     What is the right mood?
======================================
Box 2807
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     A positive, happy one where one's
soul is lifted above the dull day-to-
day mundane-ness of life.
======================================
Box 2808
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Life is not mundane, well, at
least mine's not.
======================================
Box 2809
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     It isn't so much about that, but
believing in the fanciful. Take a look
around, I am sure you will find
something that strikes your fancy.
======================================
Box 2810
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     Hey, you're Dogero, aren't you?
======================================
Box 2811
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes.
======================================
Box 2812
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     The name's Jack. I had heard you
were able to sneak into town to save
us.
======================================
Box 2813
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We were forced here. Katina has
in turn forced us to save the town
so we can get out.
======================================
Box 2814
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     Oh, I see. Can't get out with
the lockdown in effect. Sometimes I
forget about it, I don't go out much.
I spend a lot of time here.
======================================
Box 2815
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     What are you painting?
======================================
Box 2816
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     I don't know\175
======================================
Box 2817
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     That's not good.
======================================
Box 2818
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     I'm stuck, \185artist block' as
Keel calls it. I don't know what I
want to paint, just that I want to
paint something, anything\175
======================================
Box 2819
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     Hey, you could help me out. Pick
one of those paintings on the wall
there, the one you like best; I could
easily do something like those.
======================================
Box 2820
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     Pick a painting from the wall
that you like best. Whatever you pick,
I'll paint.
======================================
Box 2821
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     That one\175 it is all over the
place. I have never understood it, but
my friends tell me it is very
expressive. A gifted child drew it.
======================================
Box 2822
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     You picked the mystery painting.
I can't tell if it is happy or sad,
moving or standing still, alive or
dead.
======================================
Box 2823
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     One of my friends draws a lot of
things like that. He likes to show the
ugliness in life, but mostly what will
shock whoever sees it.
======================================
Box 2824
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     Whenever I look at that one, I
feel a heavy burden on my back. I know
people who have fallen to their knees
at the sight of it.
======================================
Box 2825
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     Should I draw something like it?
======================================
Box 2826
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     If you really want to.
======================================
Box 2827
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Go for it.
======================================
Box 2828
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Go ahead.
======================================
Box 2829
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No, not like that garbage.
======================================
Box 2830
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I sure wouldn't.
======================================
Box 2831
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     No, but it is your call.
======================================
Box 2832
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     Then pick another one.
======================================
Box 2833
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     You don't like any of them?
======================================
Box 2834
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     To be honest, none of them strike
me as something to spend time on, only
things to waste time on.
======================================
Box 2835
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I have not gained anything from
those paintings. What exactly do you
aim to gain from painting?
======================================
Box 2836
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     I've never thought of it like
that before. What I want to gain\175
======================================
Box 2837
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Stop thinking in terms of what
others like. You can't please everyone
and you shouldn't have to.
======================================
Box 2838
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Others can gain something from
your work only after you have. Who
knows what Jack wants better than
Jack himself?
======================================
Box 2839
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     Hmm\175
======================================
Box 2840
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I do not see the point in art.
======================================
Box 2841
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Yeah, you wouldn't. You don't see
the point in living.
======================================
Box 2842
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I do too.
======================================
Box 2843
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Do not.
======================================
Box 2844
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I do too times ten! The point of
my life is mine to make, not yours.
I know what I see better than you
know what I see.
======================================
Box 2845
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Ha-ha-ha!
======================================
Box 2846
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Go ahead and laugh, my life is
my own, it isn't your property. I own
it and can do what I like with it.
======================================
Box 2847
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We'll see.
======================================
Box 2848
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes, we'll see, and we will see
again and again and again.
======================================
Box 2849
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     Hmm\175
======================================
Box 2850
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I am not blind like all the fools
we have fought and are still fighting.
======================================
Box 2851
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Then why are you so hopeless?
======================================
Box 2852
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     We are all a little hopeless
after what has happened. Things have
not worked out like we have wanted
them to.
======================================
Box 2853
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Says you.
======================================
Box 2854
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     Hmm\175
======================================
Box 2855
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Like little children, bickering
back and forth, it is quite shameful.
I mean, I thought I was an adventurer
here, not a babysitter!
======================================
Box 2856
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh shutup.
======================================
Box 2857
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     I see now. I see what it is I
want to show.
======================================
Box 2858
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What is it?
======================================
Box 2859
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     Wait for it and you will see.
======================================
Box 2860
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Sure, we'll wait.
======================================
Box 2861
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     Great! Now, if you all could help
me out by\175
======================================
Box 2862
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We don't have time to wait.
======================================
Box 2863
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     Please come back immediately when
you have the time, before I lose sight
of what it is that I aim to capture.
======================================
Box 2864
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     Will you wait here while I work
on my painting? I know what it is I
want to paint now.
======================================
Box 2865
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     Finished! This is great, I must
show it to Keel. Please wait here for
me.
======================================
Box 2866
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I wonder what he drew.
======================================
Box 2867
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     From the sound of it, I suspect
something only he could have drawn.
======================================
Box 2868
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I am sure whatever it is, others
could have drawn it also.
======================================
Box 2869
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     That's not what I mean. Somebody
else could have drawn it, but that
doesn't take away his credit for
being the somebody who did.
======================================
Box 2870
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Perhaps.
======================================
Box 2871
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I know how to end this
conversation, I'll just take a peek{}
======================================
Box 2872
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     No you won't!
======================================
Box 2873
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     You sound very excited, let's
see it.
======================================
Box 2874
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     I present to you\175
======================================
Box 2875
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     The Joy of Life!
======================================
Box 2876
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     \175
======================================
Box 2877
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     What do you think?
======================================
Box 2878
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     What do I think?
======================================
Box 2879
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     Yes, what do you think?
======================================
Box 2880
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     I don't know\175
======================================
Box 2881
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     Your piece, the subject matter,
it is bright and detailed\175 your focus
is on individual characters, much like
the old classical works\175
======================================
Box 2882
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     What's wrong? You don't like it?
======================================
Box 2883
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     Well, I like it, but I don't know
why exactly. I am used to other kinds
of art, the ones where I can escape
reality and enter my own little world.
======================================
Box 2884
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     That isn't art.
======================================
Box 2885
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     Excuse me?
======================================
Box 2886
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     Art isn't about running away from
what's real, it is about running to a
certain aspect of what's real and
focusing in on it.
======================================
Box 2887
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     I see.
======================================
Box 2888
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     For the first time in a long
time, I see.
======================================
Box 2889
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     What have I been doing here? I
don't belong.
======================================
Box 2890
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     Don't say things like that.
======================================
Box 2891
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     No, I have been destroying art
for the reason that I did not want to
understand it. I feel terrible.
======================================
Box 2892
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     I do not belong here. Farewell.
======================================
Box 2893
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     Keel, wait!
======================================
Box 2894
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     That must be some painting.
======================================
Box 2895
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I do not think it is the painting
that caused this so much as the guilt
of a protector.
======================================
Box 2896
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Well, that's one less protector
to stand in our way.
======================================
Box 2897
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's go.
======================================
Box 2898
--------------------------------------
[\147 Leu]
     Welcome to Town Hall, Dogero and
company.
======================================
Box 2899
--------------------------------------
[\229 Kocyte]
     Now that you are here, you can
aid us{}
======================================
Box 2900
--------------------------------------
[\147 Leu]
     Aid the needy and helpless, we
offer a wide range of social programs
that{}
======================================
Box 2901
--------------------------------------
[\229 Kocyte]
     I am sure you are eager to help
us with, to provide for these poor
souls of Cyport.
======================================
Box 2902
--------------------------------------
[\147 Leu]
     Please help us run our
unemployment assistance program.
======================================
Box 2903
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Okay, we'll help.
======================================
Box 2904
--------------------------------------
[\229 Kocyte]
     Good, good! Right this way, I
will show you to the unemployment
assistance program room.
======================================
Box 2905
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     By no means will we help you.
======================================
Box 2906
--------------------------------------
[\229 Kocyte]
     Now, now, there is no reason to
be so selfish, do not deny{}
======================================
Box 2907
--------------------------------------
[\147 Leu]
     What makes us great, it is our
inborn drive to care for others; when
we care for others we{}
======================================
Box 2908
--------------------------------------
[\229 Kocyte]
     Care for ourselves, it profits
us all, whereas when you care only
for yourself, there is a loss of
actual gain.
======================================
Box 2909
--------------------------------------
[\147 Leu]
     To best understand this, we have
an understanding and caring program
that you should attend. Please do so
and become better individuals.
======================================
Box 2910
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Okay, we'll attend this program.
======================================
Box 2911
--------------------------------------
[\229 Kocyte]
     Good, good! Right this way, I
will show you to the understanding and
caring program lecture room.
======================================
Box 2912
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     By no means will we attend.
======================================
Box 2913
--------------------------------------
[\229 Kocyte]
     Why would you want to avoid
learning how to best understand and
care for others, unless{}
======================================
Box 2914
--------------------------------------
[\147 Leu]
     You are skeptical of the power
of loving kindness and goodwill. If
that is the case, then perhaps{}
======================================
Box 2915
--------------------------------------
[\229 Kocyte]
     It would be best if you spend
time at the library and read up on
the issue, so you can{}
======================================
Box 2916
--------------------------------------
[\147 Leu]
     See it is our side that is right.
Please, visit the library.
======================================
Box 2917
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Okay, we will visit the library.
======================================
Box 2918
--------------------------------------
[\229 Kocyte]
     Good, good! Right this way, I
will show you to the library. Once
there, you can absorb the work of
every great mind of Cyport.
======================================
Box 2919
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     By no means will we visit the
library.
======================================
Box 2920
--------------------------------------
[\229 Kocyte]
     That is a shame, shameful beyond
reason. Why do you insist on following
the beat of your own drum, when you
can{}
======================================
Box 2921
--------------------------------------
[\147 Leu]
     Follow the symphony of the larger
choir, each of us adding in our own
sound in tune with the rest, resulting
in a whole{}
======================================
Box 2922
--------------------------------------
[\229 Kocyte]
     Larger than any individual part.
If you will not let us help, then we
must let you{}
======================================
Box 2923
--------------------------------------
[\147 Leu]
     Pay us, so that with your charity
we may continue to do what is right,
even if you are unable to do such
yourself.
======================================
Box 2924
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Okay, we will pay you.
======================================
Box 2925
--------------------------------------
[\229 Kocyte]
     Good, good! Right this way, I
will show you to the collection plate.
Please, show us the full extent of
your generosity.
======================================
Box 2926
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     By no means will we pay you.
======================================
Box 2927
--------------------------------------
[\229 Kocyte]
     By no means! By no means will you
do what we tell you!
======================================
Box 2928
--------------------------------------
[\147 Leu]
     Such people cannot be reasoned
with; there is only one way to deal
with the heartless and mindless.
======================================
Box 2929
--------------------------------------
[\229 Kocyte]
     Like the slimes of the forest
absorbing nature's garbage{}
======================================
Box 2930
--------------------------------------
[\147 Leu]
     Like the healers who treat the
sick{}
======================================
Box 2931
--------------------------------------
[\229 Kocyte]
     You have left us no choice{}
======================================
Box 2932
--------------------------------------
[\147 Leu]
     But to purge you and make you
clean as the day you were born.
======================================
Box 2933
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     They're getting away!
======================================
Box 2934
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Let them run, they are harmless
now.
======================================
Box 2935
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Out of all the people I have met
on this adventure, those two have been
the worst.
======================================
Box 2936
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Katina has two less protectors to
rely on for support. We will save this
town yet.
======================================
Box 2937
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I don't think people will
understand what we have just done{}
that we're the ones helping them. I
mean, they let them do what they did.
======================================
Box 2938
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Do you suggest we run an
understand-us program?
======================================
Box 2939
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Ha-ha, no, of course not!
======================================
Box 2940
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Then let's go.
======================================
Box 2941
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Are you sure you want to confront
her again?
======================================
Box 2942
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes, it is time.
======================================
Box 2943
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No, not yet.
======================================
Box 2944
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I have returned.
======================================
Box 2945
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     This is your last chance.
======================================
Box 2946
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     My last chance to do what?
======================================
Box 2947
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     To accept I am right based on
the merits of my actions, not my
intentions.
======================================
Box 2948
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     You haven't done anything!
======================================
Box 2949
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Kill them all!
======================================
Box 2950
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I have defeated the thugs at the
docks, who forced the able to serve
the unable.
======================================
Box 2951
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I have saved the children by
bringing back the one who brought life
and purpose to the school, the mind
you had thrown out onto the street.
======================================
Box 2952
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I helped artists realize their
full potential so that they may create
works that glorify the noble, not the
ignoble.
======================================
Box 2953
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I have kicked your town hall
lackeys out of Cyport. They will
no longer harm anyone but themselves.
======================================
Box 2954
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     You\175
======================================
Box 2955
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Come to my aid! We have villains
within our walls who mean us harm!
======================================
Box 2956
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Destroy them!
======================================
Box 2957
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I have lost faith in the people
of this land.
======================================
Box 2958
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     And why do you say that?
======================================
Box 2959
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     We should not be fighting each
other, Dogero. We shouldn't have to\175
======================================
Box 2960
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I am sick of looking at you.
======================================
Box 2961
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Dogero\175 I thought you loved me\175
======================================
Box 2962
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I did.
======================================
Box 2963
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     It isn't supposed to be like
this, we're supposed to live happily
ever after\175
======================================
Box 2964
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     There are so many evil things out
there, and we were supposed to be the
ones to stop it\175
======================================
Box 2965
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I hate this land, I hate everyone
who walks it; I hate the way people
act as if everything is okay\175
======================================
Box 2966
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I hate it, Dogero.
======================================
Box 2967
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     And I hate you. I always have,
just like I have always hated Mi'la.
======================================
Box 2968
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     The rage in my heart is
unbearable. I want to fall to the
ground and never get up. But I can't.
Not now.
======================================
Box 2969
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Then there is hope for you.
======================================
Box 2970
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     No, there's no hope for anything.
======================================
Box 2971
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Everything's the same, nothing
ever really changes. Just new names
and different looks.
======================================
Box 2972
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     There is no point to any of this.
There never was. We are all fools to
be laughed at for ever having thought
otherwise.
======================================
Box 2973
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I don't want to cry anymore.
======================================
Box 2974
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Please, don't make me\175
======================================
Box 2975
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Man, ain't nothing ever going to
change\175
======================================
Box 2976
--------------------------------------
[\220 ????]
     I hear ya, I hear ya.
======================================
Box 2977
--------------------------------------
[\220 ????]
     Hey, look who's coming our way,
it's Dogero and his gang.
======================================
Box 2978
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Yeah, it's a gate and it's
locked, fools. Deal with it. You're
stuck in here with the rest of us.
======================================
Box 2979
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     What do you think you're doing?
You can't open it. Don't even try.
======================================
Box 2980
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Ha, look at these clowns.
======================================
Box 2981
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     \175
======================================
Box 2982
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     South of here is Fralin. We've
already been there.
======================================
Box 2983
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We will go to the source of
Cyport's problem, to the east, into
the Rorc Mountains.
======================================
Box 2984
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I suspect we will find what we
are looking for there.
======================================
Box 2985
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Sounds like a plan. I'm ready
when you are.
======================================
Box 2986
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Only one more valorian icon to
find, along with the two that were
stolen from us. Things aren't so bad.
======================================
Box 2987
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We still have Fedora's icon,
right?
======================================
Box 2988
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes, it is safe.
======================================
Box 2989
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I know what we will find in the
mountains, but I do not know if we
will be ready for it.
======================================
Box 2990
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     How bad can it be?
======================================
Box 2991
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Have you noticed any change in
the monsters we have had to fight up
to this point?
======================================
Box 2992
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Not really.
======================================
Box 2993
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     They are becoming more like us
in appearance.
======================================
Box 2994
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Gahn\175
======================================
Box 2995
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We have already wasted too much
time here, time to leave.
======================================
Box 2996
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I don't see any end to Gahn's
madness. We haven't accomplished much
in the larger scheme of things.
======================================
Box 2997
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     That's no reason to stop moving
forward.
======================================
Box 2998
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     All right. We may not have much
of a chance, but we still have one.
Let's go.
======================================
Box 2999
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It is way too cold out here!
======================================
Box 3000
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yeah, we'll die if we don't turn
back.
======================================
Box 3001
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We should be able to find better
clothing somewhere in Cyport.
======================================
Box 3002
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What's the matter with you!
Come on.
======================================
Box 3003
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No, I have been thinking.
======================================
Box 3004
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     That's a first!
======================================
Box 3005
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Well? What do you want me to say?
Way to go? Good job? Go team?
======================================
Box 3006
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I want you all to go back to
Cyport.
======================================
Box 3007
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Why?
======================================
Box 3008
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     This is my quest, not yours. I am
not going to drag you along against
your will.
======================================
Box 3009
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I failed to kill him, I failed to
stop all of this; it is my burden to
set things right, mine and mine alone.
======================================
Box 3010
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I will not ask you to follow me.
I have a feeling that things are about
to get a lot worse.
======================================
Box 3011
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I have been no better than him
for allowing you to come with me this
far. I am taking responsibility for
my actions.
======================================
Box 3012
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     If anyone is to die for my cause,
it will be me. Now leave.
======================================
Box 3013
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No.
======================================
Box 3014
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I said leave, this isn't your
quest. None of this is your fault.
======================================
Box 3015
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     None of this is your fault
either.
======================================
Box 3016
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Don't appease me.
======================================
Box 3017
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Do you actually think we are
following you?
======================================
Box 3018
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I'm here because I want to be,
for the gold and glory, and to take
out the source of this trouble.
======================================
Box 3019
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I am not going to let him destroy
what I know is right. I want to, no,
I will stop him!
======================================
Box 3020
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     We can stop him, I know we can.
======================================
Box 3021
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I had wanted to stay in New
Keltan after we stopped the raiders,
but after having been forced out here,
I understand I had the wrong resolve.
======================================
Box 3022
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I will not wait to die. If they
aim to kill me, then I will fight
them. Gahn, all of them, they will all
pay for what they have done to me.
======================================
Box 3023
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     And I will be the one who kills
him. That is my direction, and I will
have no regrets.
======================================
Box 3024
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Get it through your thick head:
no one is following you. We are all
here because we want to be.
======================================
Box 3025
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You are not the only one who
hates what Gahn has done. I hate him
more than all of you combined.
======================================
Box 3026
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     The only reason I am allowing you
to have the honor of my company is
that I know you hate him too.
======================================
Box 3027
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We will be the ones who stop him,
and do you know why?
======================================
Box 3028
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Exactly.
======================================
Box 3029
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I never want to hear talk like
this again from any of you.
======================================
Box 3030
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Hmm.
======================================
Box 3031
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What is it?
======================================
Box 3032
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     The thought just came to me\175
======================================
Box 3033
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Has it occurred to any of you
that perhaps this is what Gahn wants
us to do?
======================================
Box 3034
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What do you mean?
======================================
Box 3035
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Who brought us here?
======================================
Box 3036
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Dart did, but he seemed to have
been working independently from Gahn.
======================================
Box 3037
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Yes, do you not find that
strange?
======================================
Box 3038
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I see what you're getting at, but
how does that explain what we did in
Cyport? We cleaned house! Surely he
didn't plan that.
======================================
Box 3039
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Or did he?
======================================
Box 3040
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I have never understood how he
thinks, but I wouldn't put it past him
to have sent us to \185teach' Katina some
lesson.
======================================
Box 3041
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     This isn't good. I think you were
right, we may not be ready for this.
We've walked into a trap before\175
======================================
Box 3042
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What do you think, Mi'la?
======================================
Box 3043
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Well\175 blast.
======================================
Box 3044
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Mi'la at a loss of words? This
must really be bad!
======================================
Box 3045
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh shutup.
======================================
Box 3046
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I have a feeling this is only
going to get worse the farther we go.
======================================
Box 3047
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What I have been thinking, is
what kind of Rorc Mountain creatures
can live in this weather? It's
horrible.
======================================
Box 3048
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I have never been this cold
before, it is a new experience. Not
one I enjoy.
======================================
Box 3049
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I wonder how many protectors
died defending Cyport when the
monsters came.
======================================
Box 3050
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I haven't seen any bodies; the
snow must have covered any sign of
the battle.
======================================
Box 3051
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Stop it.
======================================
Box 3052
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Stop what?
======================================
Box 3053
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You are making me uneasy.
======================================
Box 3054
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     We're all a bit uncomfortable.
I don't think anyone ever really gets
used to this kind of business.
======================================
Box 3055
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I never have.
======================================
Box 3056
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It is not a bad feeling, but
something to hold onto; it is what
reminds me that I am not one of them.
======================================
Box 3057
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Someone has to stand up to
monsters, and I have chosen to be
that someone.
======================================
Box 3058
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It is okay to have anxiety, but
it is not okay to let anxiety take
control of your direction.
======================================
Box 3059
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Okay, I'm better. Let's continue.
======================================
Box 3060
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What is a house doing out here?
======================================
Box 3061
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's check it out.
======================================
Box 3062
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     What are you doing in my home?
Get out of here!
======================================
Box 3063
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We don't mean you any harm.
======================================
Box 3064
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     Can't you let an old man die in
peace? I haven't done anything to you,
I haven't done anything\175
======================================
Box 3065
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     Please don't kill me, I don't
want to die\175
======================================
Box 3066
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What is going on here?
======================================
Box 3067
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     I'm sorry I ran away, but I can't
work for him. I tried and I tried,
and look what I got for it. Nothing
but wasted years.
======================================
Box 3068
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You ran away from Gahn?
======================================
Box 3069
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     Don't say his name! He might hear
you, he has ears and eyes all over
this land.
======================================
Box 3070
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     But yes, I once worked for him.
Has he sent you to kill me?
======================================
Box 3071
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We do not work for him.
======================================
Box 3072
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     In fact, we seek to kill him.
======================================
Box 3073
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     You do!
======================================
Box 3074
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     I mean, you do?
======================================
Box 3075
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes.
======================================
Box 3076
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     That's a fool's quest if ever
I have heard one in all my life.
======================================
Box 3077
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     All I could do was escape, most
are not as lucky{}yet you, you people
who just happened to wander into my
home\175
======================================
Box 3078
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     You think you can do the
impossible? You actually think you
can fight him? There's no way, no one
says things like that and lives long.
======================================
Box 3079
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     We do not merely plan to fight
him. We plan to kill him.
======================================
Box 3080
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     Ha-ha, I sure needed that. I
haven't heard anything so ridiculous
in all my seasons.
======================================
Box 3081
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     Tell you crazies what, I haven't
had company in a long, long time; you
are welcome to stay here and hide
with me if you want.
======================================
Box 3082
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We are headed to the Rorc
Mountains.
======================================
Box 3083
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     You're even crazier than I
thought.
======================================
Box 3084
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     No self-respecting person who
values their life would ever want to
go there. It's the kind of place you'd
have to be forced into\175
======================================
Box 3085
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What do you know about it?
======================================
Box 3086
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     Not much, except I have seen a
lot of people who've walked past here
in that direction.
======================================
Box 3087
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     They all had their heads hung
real low, the kind of people who
aren't blind or deaf but seem that
way.
======================================
Box 3088
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     None of them noticed my house.
I don't think any of them really cared
to look.
======================================
Box 3089
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     Well, there was one who stopped
to look, and I came out eventually
after he was staring for so long, and
what he told me\175
======================================
Box 3090
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     He told me he was headed to the
Rorc Mountains and wanted to know the
way. I told him and asked why he
wanted to go there.
======================================
Box 3091
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     He just brushed his cape aside
and left me. I heard him say under his
breath that you-know-who lives atop
that mountain. He seemed troubled.
======================================
Box 3092
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     This picture\175
======================================
Box 3093
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     It is a picture of my brother
and me. He was killed when we ran
away.
======================================
Box 3094
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     You-know-who killed him, I know
he did. There was nothing I could do
about it.
======================================
Box 3095
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     Just have to keep on running.
======================================
Box 3096
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Thank you for your time. We must
leave.
======================================
Box 3097
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     You're welcome to come back and
stay if you like.
======================================
Box 3098
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     You can't defeat him, you'll see
what I mean eventually.
======================================
Box 3099
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     That was a strange person.
======================================
Box 3100
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Dogero?
======================================
Box 3101
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What's wrong?
======================================
Box 3102
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Let him be.
======================================
Box 3103
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     That man\175
======================================
Box 3104
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Dogero\175
======================================
Box 3105
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Are you okay?
======================================
Box 3106
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     \175
======================================
Box 3107
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Perhaps it would be a good idea
for us to set up camp.
======================================
Box 3108
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yeah, I don't have the energy to
go any further.
======================================
Box 3109
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Are we giving up?
======================================
Box 3110
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     No, we are taking a needed rest,
that is all.
======================================
Box 3111
--------------------------------------
[\147 Slip]
     Hey! It is one-eyed la-la head.
======================================
Box 3112
--------------------------------------
[\221 Tack]
     You're so ugly. I feel sorry for
your parents.
======================================
Box 3113
--------------------------------------
[\147 Slip]
     I feel sorry for us since we have
to look at her.
======================================
Box 3114
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Leave me alone!
======================================
Box 3115
--------------------------------------
[\221 Tack]
     You think you are so great.
You're no better than any of us.
======================================
Box 3116
--------------------------------------
[\147 Slip]
     You don't have any friends,
because you don't have a life.
======================================
Box 3117
--------------------------------------
[\221 Tack]
     Why are you so different? Why
won't you play with us?
======================================
Box 3118
--------------------------------------
[\147 Slip]
     No one likes you because you're
always in your own little world, and
you never want to leave it.
======================================
Box 3119
--------------------------------------
[\221 Tack]
     Yeah, there is a place called
reality, why don't you live in it with
the rest of us for once?
======================================
Box 3120
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Because I don't like any of you.
======================================
Box 3121
--------------------------------------
[\221 Tack]
     Yeah, well we don't like you
either.
======================================
Box 3122
--------------------------------------
[\147 Slip]
     It must be sad to have to play
by yourself all day.
======================================
Box 3123
--------------------------------------
[\232 Cap]
     Hey, she can play with us! We
were just about to play a game of{}
======================================
Box 3124
--------------------------------------
[\232 Cap]
     Dodge ball!
======================================
Box 3125
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     Do not stop because of me. You
are doing fine.
======================================
Box 3126
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I am?
======================================
Box 3127
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     Yes. No one practices as much as
you, it is refreshing to see.
======================================
Box 3128
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     No one is close to you in talent
or skill.
======================================
Box 3129
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Not even Dogero?
======================================
Box 3130
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     Not even Dogero. He has
potential, but he hardly ever shows
up for training.
======================================
Box 3131
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     You are close to him in that
respect.
======================================
Box 3132
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Sometimes I don't feel like
showing up.
======================================
Box 3133
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     And that is it? You do not feel
bad in missing your training on
purpose?
======================================
Box 3134
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Should I feel bad?
======================================
Box 3135
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     I have noticed what you have been
doing.
======================================
Box 3136
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     Do you know to what I refer?
======================================
Box 3137
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No.
======================================
Box 3138
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     You do not feel embarrassed that
I know your secret?
======================================
Box 3139
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What secret?
======================================
Box 3140
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     You miss training because you
wait for Dogero to awake each day.
======================================
Box 3141
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I don't always wait on him, or
else I would miss as many days as he
does.
======================================
Box 3142
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     Why do you not simply wake him
up?
======================================
Box 3143
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     For the same reason you won't.
======================================
Box 3144
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You can't force someone to get
better, they have to want it.
======================================
Box 3145
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     Yes, I remember saying something
like that. You are very sharp.
======================================
Box 3146
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Why do you cover half of your
face with your hair?
======================================
Box 3147
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     I could ask the same of you.
======================================
Box 3148
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     \175
======================================
Box 3149
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     What's wrong?
======================================
Box 3150
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Are you blind in that eye?
======================================
Box 3151
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     Ah, so that is it.
======================================
Box 3152
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     My eye works, but I choose to
keep it closed.
======================================
Box 3153
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Why?
======================================
Box 3154
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     Why not?
======================================
Box 3155
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     If my eye worked, I would never
close it!
======================================
Box 3156
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     I do not doubt that.
======================================
Box 3157
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     But there comes a time in
everyone's life when their eyes close
forever, never to open again.
======================================
Box 3158
--------------------------------------

     The things we want most, most
likely will never be ours to have.
What we see is not always what we get.
I keep my eye closed as a reminder.
======================================
Box 3159
--------------------------------------

     When you discover that your
dreams remain forever beyond your
reach, you will understand what I
mean.
======================================
Box 3160
--------------------------------------

     You are young. You know you will
have matured once you have accepted
this. As wisdom comes to the aged,
so too does weariness and humility.
======================================
Box 3161
--------------------------------------

     It is only a matter of time.
======================================
Box 3162
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Is anyone awake?
======================================
Box 3163
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I am.
======================================
Box 3164
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Dogero is the only one who is
sleeping.
======================================
Box 3165
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     That guy looked nothing like him.
======================================
Box 3166
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Those who live in fear age
faster.
======================================
Box 3167
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Yes, it is not natural for the
living to fear living.
======================================
Box 3168
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     He looked old enough to be his
grandfather, not his brother.
======================================
Box 3169
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Everyone we fight seems older
than they really are.
======================================
Box 3170
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yeah, I noticed that too. They
make us seem like children in
comparison.
======================================
Box 3171
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Back in the Forest Pass, all me
and Dogero fought were monsters. Not
people-monsters, but animal-monsters.
======================================
Box 3172
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     The kind of creatures that only
eat and sleep, never accomplishing
anything greater than digging a hole,
or killing some other animal.
======================================
Box 3173
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Back in Adlez, a lot of people
told me the greatest thing one can do
is have a child.
======================================
Box 3174
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I don't see it like that; anyone
can have a child, even monsters.
======================================
Box 3175
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Yes, that cannot be the greatest
thing in life. We are better than
animals.
======================================
Box 3176
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     There are those who would say
otherwise.
======================================
Box 3177
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What did they do to you?
======================================
Box 3178
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Things I wish I never allowed
them to do.
======================================
Box 3179
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Sorry for asking, I was just
curious. I know it must have been
painful.
======================================
Box 3180
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     No, it is okay. I do not mind
talking to you about it.
======================================
Box 3181
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     They beat me, kept me hungry,
forced me to beat others\175
======================================
Box 3182
--------------------------------------
     I remember a man's back that was
a tangled crust of fur and dried
blood. He asked me to feed him.
======================================
Box 3183
--------------------------------------
     That is when it first hit me,
that I realized what exactly was
going on.
======================================
Box 3184
--------------------------------------
     It happened gradually, for
reasons everyone had accepted because
it seemed right, at first.
======================================
Box 3185
--------------------------------------
     People treated each other like
icons. Another man's strengths could
become your own, along with his
weaknesses.
======================================
Box 3186
--------------------------------------
     Those who died{}many had died
before I ran away{}their anima was
collected and given to those who
needed it the most.
======================================
Box 3187
--------------------------------------
     Of course, those who needed it
the most were the weakest, those who
had never sought to improve themselves
by their own hand.
======================================
Box 3188
--------------------------------------
     Icons tend to take a heavy toll
on one's health, as you know. The
user's soul is used to fuel them.
======================================
Box 3189
--------------------------------------
     Icons were relied on so much that
the majority of people were too weak
to do anything, relying on me and the
other protectors for support.
======================================
Box 3190
--------------------------------------
     If one relies on an icon for too
long, the anima contained within will
shape the user into the creature it
came from.
======================================
Box 3191
--------------------------------------
     That is why I look the way I do.
======================================
Box 3192
--------------------------------------
     There was one icon I used back
then. It remained at my side for many
seasons. It was marked \185Grinlow'.
======================================
Box 3193
--------------------------------------
     It gave me great strength and
endurance, but at a high cost. A cost
I regret paying.
======================================
Box 3194
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I imagine Rorc will be like that,
the old Keltan.
======================================
Box 3195
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I hope not.
======================================
Box 3196
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Hey\175
======================================
Box 3197
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Where did Mi'la go?
======================================
Box 3198
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Dogero, wakeup.
======================================
Box 3199
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What is it?
======================================
Box 3200
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Mi'la is gone. I don't know where
she went.
======================================
Box 3201
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Wait here for me, I will go find
her.
======================================
Box 3202
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     We'll come with you.
======================================
Box 3203
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Don't.
======================================
Box 3204
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     She has acted like this ever
since we were children, and I know
why.
======================================
Box 3205
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It is time I put an end to it.
======================================
Box 3206
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Hmm.
======================================
Box 3207
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Did you notice he did not draw
his sword when you woke him?
======================================
Box 3208
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yeah, I don't think he is
himself.
======================================
Box 3209
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Perhaps he is himself now, and
was not himself before.
======================================
Box 3210
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Are you awake?
======================================
Box 3211
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Yes.
======================================
Box 3212
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What are you doing out here?
======================================
Box 3213
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I'm looking.
======================================
Box 3214
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Look how big and empty it is out
there. The sky looks like it goes on
forever.
======================================
Box 3215
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I like the look of it.
======================================
Box 3216
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I know why you left.
======================================
Box 3217
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You only think you do. You're so
slow.
======================================
Box 3218
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Then tell me why.
======================================
Box 3219
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I wanted some time alone, to
think about things.
======================================
Box 3220
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What things?
======================================
Box 3221
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You're hopeless, that's what.
======================================
Box 3222
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Say it.
======================================
Box 3223
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No, there is nothing to say.
======================================
Box 3224
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It is okay, say it.
======================================
Box 3225
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It is not okay.
======================================
Box 3226
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I want to hear you say it.
======================================
Box 3227
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We are not animals.
======================================
Box 3228
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I know.
======================================
Box 3229
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It makes me feel uncomfortable.
======================================
Box 3230
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Say it.
======================================
Box 3231
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I am not going to say it.
======================================
Box 3232
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Then I will.
======================================
Box 3233
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No, don't\175
======================================
Box 3234
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Do not deny me the only thing
that has kept me going this far.
======================================
Box 3235
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     At first I thought this would be
fun, but now, things are a lot more
difficult. I need this to keep going.
======================================
Box 3236
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Don't take it away from me.
======================================
Box 3237
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Stand up and look me in the eyes.
======================================
Box 3238
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No, please don't tell me, don't
crush my dreams\175
======================================
Box 3239
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Stand up!
======================================
Box 3240
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You are the most confident person
I know, yet you cannot face me? Are
you that afraid of what I might say?
======================================
Box 3241
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     \175
======================================
Box 3242
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     When we were children, I was a
coward.
======================================
Box 3243
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I liked to sleep all day. Did you
ever figure out why?
======================================
Box 3244
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Because you were lazy?
======================================
Box 3245
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No, it was because I was a
coward.
======================================
Box 3246
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I was afraid of you.
======================================
Box 3247
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I didn't want to wakeup, because
I knew you would already be awake.
======================================
Box 3248
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I didn't want to play games,
because I knew you would always win.
======================================
Box 3249
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I didn't want to train, because
I knew you would be better no matter
how hard I tried.
======================================
Box 3250
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I thought I could never be as
good as you. I wanted to give up, but
you wouldn't let me.
======================================
Box 3251
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What are you saying?
======================================
Box 3252
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I want you, Mi'la. I have always
wanted you.
======================================
Box 3253
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Dogero\175
======================================
Box 3254
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I am not afraid anymore. I
finally feel worthy of your presence.
======================================
Box 3255
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I will never give up again from
this point on, no matter what happens.
======================================
Box 3256
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You never have. I have always
admired you for that.
======================================
Box 3257
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     And I have always admired you.
======================================
Box 3258
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Stop it, you are making me
uncomfortable.
======================================
Box 3259
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Why? Because I am being honest?
======================================
Box 3260
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Because\175
======================================
Box 3261
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Because you have been used to
keeping this feeling a secret?
======================================
Box 3262
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Yes, because I\175
======================================
Box 3263
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I know.
======================================
Box 3264
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     How much longer should we wait on
them?
======================================
Box 3265
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I don't know.
======================================
Box 3266
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Do you think they will ever come
back?
======================================
Box 3267
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I hope they will.
======================================
Box 3268
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     About time!
======================================
Box 3269
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What took you so long?
======================================
Box 3270
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     That's none of your business.
======================================
Box 3271
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Ha-ha-ha!
======================================
Box 3272
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What's so funny?
======================================
Box 3273
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Oh, nothing. Did you two sleep
well?
======================================
Box 3274
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Why do you ask?
======================================
Box 3275
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Didn't sleep much, did you?
======================================
Box 3276
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Why is this dwarf interested in
how much we slept?
======================================
Box 3277
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We don't have time for this.
======================================
Box 3278
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Did anything happen while we were
gone?
======================================
Box 3279
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Yes, your brother was kidnapped.
======================================
Box 3280
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Unbelievable.
======================================
Box 3281
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     There were too many of them{}
we couldn't do anything but hide!
======================================
Box 3282
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     From the way they went about it,
it seemed as if they wanted us to see
them. They made no effort to conceal
their destination.
======================================
Box 3283
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Where were they headed?
======================================
Box 3284
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     To the Rorc Mountains.
======================================
Box 3285
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     This is a trap.
======================================
Box 3286
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Come on, we better not disappoint
them.
======================================
Box 3287
--------------------------------------
     Behold what happens when we lose
touch with our Fate! Have mercy on his
anima, Gahn of power and might.
======================================
Box 3288
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What have they done?
======================================
Box 3289
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     This is unforgivable.
======================================
Box 3290
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Is he still alive?
======================================
Box 3291
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     He better be, for their sake.
======================================
Box 3292
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     He is breathing.
======================================
Box 3293
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     They found me\175 they found me\175
======================================
Box 3294
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Who did this to you?
======================================
Box 3295
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     Find the protector\175 there is only
one in Rorc\175
======================================
Box 3296
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     Rorc\175 it has the key\175
======================================
Box 3297
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We will get it and return as
quickly as we can.
======================================
Box 3298
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     Wait\175
======================================
Box 3299
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     The protector\175 it is not like any
you may have seen\175
======================================
Box 3300
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     It is not of this world\175
======================================
Box 3301
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Save your breath. It will pay for
what it has done.
======================================
Box 3302
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     Our humble protector is in the
middle of conducting a sacred rite.
Please do not disturb us.
======================================
Box 3303
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     Sir, please, do not\175
======================================
Box 3304
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh shutup.
======================================
Box 3305
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What is that thing?
======================================
Box 3306
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     It must be the protector of Rorc.
======================================
Box 3307
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     Correct.
======================================
Box 3308
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     You have interrupted my service.
Why?
======================================
Box 3309
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Give me the key.
======================================
Box 3310
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     I cannot do that.
======================================
Box 3311
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I didn't think you would.
======================================
Box 3312
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     You are not welcome here. Leave.
======================================
Box 3313
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We will leave with the key.
======================================
Box 3314
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     You have already done too much
harm to the faithful of Rorc. Leave.
======================================
Box 3315
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes, I know.
======================================
Box 3316
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     The very sight of me and what I
stand for is enough to cause damage
here.
======================================
Box 3317
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     The people suffer enough, have
mercy on them. Leave.
======================================
Box 3318
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You appear to feed off of their
suffering.
======================================
Box 3319
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     These people have given up on
life, and you protect them from what?
What is there to protect here?
======================================
Box 3320
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What value are you defending!
Suffering? Inability? Dependence?
======================================
Box 3321
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     I pity them enough to protect
them from those who would do them
harm.
======================================
Box 3322
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You have done them harm, look
around you; are any of these poor
creatures better off than when they
first arrived?
======================================
Box 3323
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You have only prolonged their
pain{}you probably even tell them it
is okay and that they should embrace
it.
======================================
Box 3324
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I want the key to end the pain of
the man you have chained to the gate.
======================================
Box 3325
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     I cannot do that, that man serves
us all as a reminder of{}
======================================
Box 3326
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh shutup already! If you want us
to leave, force us out of here.
======================================
Box 3327
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     Nothing is accomplished with
violence, let us continue our
discourse{}
======================================
Box 3328
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Be a protector and defend your
slaves!
======================================
Box 3329
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     If that is what you wish, then
I will comply.
======================================
Box 3330
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     Do not forget you desired this;
I cannot be held accountable, no
matter the outcome.
======================================
Box 3331
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What was that thing? I have never
seen a creature like it before.
======================================
Box 3332
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     It was once like you and me.
======================================
Box 3333
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     It relied on icons containing
anima more powerful than its own for
too long. The anima drained its
health, along with its mind.
======================================
Box 3334
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Is there any way to cure that?
======================================
Box 3335
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     None that I know of.
======================================
Box 3336
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What are you looking at!
======================================
Box 3337
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's go.
======================================
Box 3338
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     Thank you for saving me.
======================================
Box 3339
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What is behind this gate?
======================================
Box 3340
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     It is a tomb to one of the
valorians, Shoda's, I think. I
wouldn't go in there if I were you.
======================================
Box 3341
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Good thing you aren't us.
======================================
Box 3342
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     You are crazy for wanting to go
against him.
======================================
Box 3343
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     There was a man who ordered the
protector of this place to chain me up
there. He was the same person who
asked me how to get here not long ago.
======================================
Box 3344
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     He knew you were coming.
======================================
Box 3345
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Dart.
======================================
Box 3346
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     He wanted me to tell you he has
your missing icons, and he is inside
getting the last one.
======================================
Box 3347
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     He said he knew you would want to
go inside, and he would be ready for
you.
======================================
Box 3348
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     It is a trap.
======================================
Box 3349
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I would expect that much.
======================================
Box 3350
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Trap or no trap, we are going in
there.
======================================
Box 3351
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     Don't say I didn't warn you.
======================================
Box 3352
--------------------------------------
     They are within the tomb.
======================================
Box 3353
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     So what?
======================================
Box 3354
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     They will never make it this far.
I am not needed here.
======================================
Box 3355
--------------------------------------
     You are needed.
======================================
Box 3356
--------------------------------------
     You have forgotten your place.
You must relearn the lesson of
futility. 
======================================
Box 3357
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     What are you saying?
======================================
Box 3358
--------------------------------------
     You believe they stand a chance.
======================================
Box 3359
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I am not sure who stands a chance
anymore.
======================================
Box 3360
--------------------------------------
     Then there is hope for you.
======================================
Box 3361
--------------------------------------
     Witness firsthand the folly of
heroism. Watch them suffer just to
come to you.
======================================
Box 3362
--------------------------------------
     Their mistake runs parallel to
your own doubt. They think they can
when they cannot; you doubt they
cannot and secretly hope they can.
======================================
Box 3363
--------------------------------------
     It will take no longer than
7 days for you to give in completely
and accept failure.
======================================
Box 3364
--------------------------------------
     Only then will you be worthy of
my standard.
======================================
Box 3365
--------------------------------------
     Watch as they suffer, just to
come to you.
======================================
Box 3366
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     What is taking them so long?
======================================
Box 3367
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     What is the greater point to all
of this?
======================================
Box 3368
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Is Gahn the only one who can
show me?
======================================
Box 3369
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I cannot wait much longer.
======================================
Box 3370
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     He was right. They are hopeless.
======================================
Box 3371
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     You made it.
======================================
Box 3372
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I didn't think you'd make it,
but you did.
======================================
Box 3373
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What are you talking about?
======================================
Box 3374
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     There is one last thing I must
see for myself, and you will show me.
======================================
Box 3375
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Meet me below.
======================================
Box 3376
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What do we do now?
======================================
Box 3377
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It is too deep to jump down. We
will have to find some other way.
======================================
Box 3378
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     These other platforms probably
work like the one in the center.
======================================
Box 3379
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We will split up, one person per
platform.
======================================
Box 3380
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You do remember this is a trap,
correct?
======================================
Box 3381
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I have not forgotten.
======================================
Box 3382
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     There hasn't been a trap that
could stop us yet. They have tried
before, and their traps have backfired
without exception.
======================================
Box 3383
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Gahn believes that by setting
people against us, against the
direction we each have chosen, that he
can somehow trick us off it.
======================================
Box 3384
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     He has failed. Failure has been
his direction from the start, he and
his faithful have come to us as
nothing more than traps{}
======================================
Box 3385
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Traps that only work if we see
them as traps and not for what they
really are: failures.
======================================
Box 3386
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We have finally caught up with
Dart, and you believe he has set a
trap for us?
======================================
Box 3387
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     He has forgotten his dream, and
we, by not forgetting our own, remind
him of his failure. He has been on the
run and there is nowhere left for him.
======================================
Box 3388
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Failures can only slow us down,
they can never stop us.
======================================
Box 3389
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     No regrets.
======================================
Box 3390
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's pick platforms. We will see
who is caught in a trap.
======================================
Box 3391
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     You have me surrounded.
======================================
Box 3392
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Gahn did not mention this as
part of the plan. Looks like the odds
are stacked against me.
======================================
Box 3393
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Are you going to give up?
======================================
Box 3394
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Of course not. I am going to win.
======================================
Box 3395
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Then there is hope for you yet.
======================================
Box 3396
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Funny, Gahn said the same thing
to me, but in the exact opposite
context.
======================================
Box 3397
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I have been watching over your
progress, and you have shown me
something I cannot put into words.
======================================
Box 3398
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     It is that something we all lost
on top of Grinlow Spiral. You seemed
to have recovered it.
======================================
Box 3399
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It is not too late for you to do
the same.
======================================
Box 3400
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     No, I am going to give this one
last go.
======================================
Box 3401
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     You have something I have lost,
and I have something you have lost.
======================================
Box 3402
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     The icons of Anon and Gitleh are
yours to take. I also have the last
one to complete your collection,
Shoda's icon. I will give them to you.
======================================
Box 3403
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You're just going to give them
to us? Is this some sort of trick?
======================================
Box 3404
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Yes, it is, actually. You will
have to fight me for them.
======================================
Box 3405
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We do not have to do this.
======================================
Box 3406
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     No! Do not talk to me like I am
just another minion of Gahn standing
in your way.
======================================
Box 3407
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I am sick of him, even though he
is my master. Through him, I was
supposed to become stronger than
I ever could on my own\175
======================================
Box 3408
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I have chosen my side. If I am
going down, I will go down in one last
blaze of glory.
======================================
Box 3409
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     You and Mi'la were always
stronger than me, and now it is time
for me to show you how powerful I have
become.
======================================
Box 3410
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I have been training my whole
life for this fight. I am not going
to hold anything back.
======================================
Box 3411
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     And neither will we.
======================================
Box 3412
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I wouldn't have it any other way.
======================================
Box 3413
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     You fools, look at what you have
done!
======================================
Box 3414
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Come on, this whole place is
falling apart!
======================================
Box 3415
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Give me the icons.
======================================
Box 3416
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I have failed to stop you. Take
them all, I never want to see them
again.
======================================
Box 3417
--------------------------------------
 \169 Acquired \147 Shoda \149 Anon \150 Gitleh \169
======================================
Box 3418
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Let's get out of here! You too,
Dart.
======================================
Box 3419
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I am not going to run away. I am
tired of running.
======================================
Box 3420
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Come on, Dogero! We don't have
time for the dead.
======================================
Box 3421
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     You are a fool to think you can
defeat him{}it is hopeless!
======================================
Box 3422
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Everything is hopeless, there is
no way any of us can last much longer
against his will{}everyone who has
tried has failed.
======================================
Box 3423
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Kill me now, I am giving you the
honor; do not force me to kill myself!
======================================
Box 3424
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No.
======================================
Box 3425
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Hurry up and kill me! You don't
have much longer until this entire
place collapses.
======================================
Box 3426
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I cannot kill someone who has
already killed himself.
======================================
Box 3427
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     If you believe you don't have a
chance, then you have killed any
chance you may have had.
======================================
Box 3428
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     This is your last chance. If you
aren't blind, you'll see that.
======================================
Box 3429
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     \175
======================================
Box 3430
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Dogero, don't ever scare me like
that again!
======================================
Box 3431
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I had to give him one last
chance. He didn't take it.
======================================
Box 3432
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     So much for Dart.
======================================
Box 3433
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     He seemed like he was once a
great man.
======================================
Box 3434
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     He was.
======================================
Box 3435
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What do we do now?
======================================
Box 3436
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Should we consult Shoda, or the
other valorians? We have them all now.
======================================
Box 3437
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We don't need them! We have never
needed them.
======================================
Box 3438
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Then what are we going to do?
======================================
Box 3439
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We will climb down this mountain.
======================================
Box 3440
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You're crazy!
======================================
Box 3441
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Crazy like a fox.
======================================
Box 3442
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What's that suppose to mean?
======================================
Box 3443
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It means: shutup and start
climbing.
======================================
Box 3444
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Okay, okay, no need to bark.
======================================
Box 3445
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I do not bark!
======================================
Box 3446
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Woof-woof!
======================================
Box 3447
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You little creep.
======================================
Box 3448
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What do we do now?
======================================
Box 3449
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It is too deep to jump down. We
will have to find some other way.
======================================
Box 3450
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     These platforms look like they
can allow us to descend.
======================================
Box 3451
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We will split up, one person per
platform.
======================================
Box 3452
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We have you surrounded.
======================================
Box 3453
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I don't care.
======================================
Box 3454
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Then give us our icons back.
======================================
Box 3455
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     No, how about I kill you instead.
======================================
Box 3456
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     You can't defeat me, it will take
more than that.
======================================
Box 3457
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Let's finish him.
======================================
Box 3458
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     He never stood a chance.
======================================
Box 3459
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Stand back.
======================================
Box 3460
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     This is our fight as much as it
is yours{}
======================================
Box 3461
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Stand back!
======================================
Box 3462
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     This is between them now, we can
only watch.
======================================
Box 3463
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I hate you, Dogero.
======================================
Box 3464
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I hate you for having Mi'la, for
Mi'la always liking you, for you
being better than me\175
======================================
Box 3465
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     But all of that is meaningless.
I am the most powerful now, thanks to
Gahn.
======================================
Box 3466
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     You don't stand a chance.
======================================
Box 3467
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We will see.
======================================
Box 3468
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I hate you!
======================================
Box 3469
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Dogero!
======================================
Box 3470
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     It isn't supposed to be like
this.
======================================
Box 3471
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     And what is it suppose to be
like, Dart?
======================================
Box 3472
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I\175 do not know.
======================================
Box 3473
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What did you expect by following
the direction given to you to its end?
======================================
Box 3474
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     This is what you sought under
Gahn, and now it is yours.
======================================
Box 3475
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You are right, it didn't have to
be like this. You had a choice, and
you chose poorly.
======================================
Box 3476
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I will make him pay for forcing
this choice onto you. You have my
promise.
======================================
Box 3477
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Are you hurt?
======================================
Box 3478
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No, I am fine.
======================================
Box 3479

======================================
Box 3480
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What now?
======================================
Box 3481
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We will climb down to the
entrance.
======================================
Box 3482
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Do we have to?
======================================
Box 3483
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes, let's go.
======================================
Box 3484
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Once a man chooses his destiny,
there is nothing we can do to change
it.
======================================
Box 3485
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I know.
======================================
Box 3486
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     No regrets, Mi'la.
======================================
Box 3487
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     You're alive!
======================================
Box 3488
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We found what we were looking
for.
======================================
Box 3489
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     That is good to hear, I didn't
think you could do it. I stand
corrected.
======================================
Box 3490
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     Maybe you do stand a chance
against him.
======================================
Box 3491
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     Who are you guys?
======================================
Box 3492
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I am Dogero.
======================================
Box 3493
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I'm Johan.
======================================
Box 3494
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Pyrus.
======================================
Box 3495
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I'm perfect.
======================================
Box 3496
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     She's Mi'la.
======================================
Box 3497
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What is your name?
======================================
Box 3498
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     My name? I don't remember\175
======================================
Box 3499
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Pick one then.
======================================
Box 3500
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     People don't pick their names,
names are something given to people.
======================================
Box 3501
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You're a person, aren't you?
Give yourself a name.
======================================
Box 3502
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     Ha-ha, I like your logic. Let's
see\175
======================================
Box 3503
--------------------------------------
[\229 ????]
     You can call me ${H10}.
======================================
Box 3504
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Nice to meet you, ${H10}.
======================================
Box 3505
--------------------------------------
[\229 ${H10}]
     From this point on, I will live
my life how I want. I will no longer
hide in fear of Gahn.
======================================
Box 3506
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Excellent.
======================================
Box 3507
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Where do we go now?
======================================
Box 3508
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I don't know.
======================================
Box 3509
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     We have all four of the valorian
icons. It is time.
======================================
Box 3510
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     They will defeat Gahn, so long as
we can find him.
======================================
Box 3511
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Where could he be?
======================================
Box 3512
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I have no idea.
======================================
Box 3513
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     He is everywhere and nowhere.
======================================
Box 3514
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     We have seen him in the various
forms he assumes: the dread and
fugitive minds, the weak and hopeless;
yet we have never seen him in person.
======================================
Box 3515
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     It is almost as if he does not
exist, except as some sort of
conceptual burden people carry.
======================================
Box 3516
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     He is real, like it or not. He is
as real as you or me, nothing greater.
======================================
Box 3517
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I last saw him at Grinlow Spiral.
We should start our search there.
======================================
Box 3518
--------------------------------------
[\229 ${H10}]
     I own a house near Grinlow, near
Fralin. I am not afraid of going back,
not any longer.
======================================
Box 3519
--------------------------------------
[\229 ${H10}]
     You are welcome to come with me
and stay as long as you like.
======================================
Box 3520
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Okay, we'll go to your house and
work from there.
======================================
Box 3521
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Finally decided to wakeup, I see.
======================================
Box 3522
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No training today, Master has
some business with the elders.
======================================
Box 3523
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You're not going back to sleep,
are you?
======================================
Box 3524
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     It is good to see you.
======================================
Box 3525
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I love days like this, don't you?
Nothing to do, everyone is happy, it
is great.
======================================
Box 3526
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I am going to pick flowers by the
pond soon. Meet me there, okay?
======================================
Box 3527
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I don't feel like talking.
======================================
Box 3528
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Master said that out of all of
us, I needed the most improvement.
I am tired of everyone and what they
have to say.
======================================
Box 3529
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     One day I will be better than
everyone here, so long as I keep my
confidence.
======================================
Box 3530
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Something is going down with the
elders and Master. What do you think
it could be?
======================================
Box 3531
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I think it has something to do
with our training, but I am not sure.
======================================
Box 3532
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Might not be anything more than
a meeting on the general affairs of
things or something boring like that.
======================================
Box 3533
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Hey Dogero, did you hear about
the meeting? I snuck in and listened
for a bit.
======================================
Box 3534
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     It is about some recent monster
sightings in the forest. They think
there is a chance the monster threat
is organized by someone.
======================================
Box 3535
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Master has fought monsters
before, he could defend us.
======================================
Box 3536
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I'm glad you could make it.
======================================
Box 3537
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     We were just getting started.
======================================
Box 3538
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Something's not right\175
======================================
Box 3539
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Huh?
======================================
Box 3540
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     No!
======================================
Box 3541
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We have to get out of here, come
on!
======================================
Box 3542
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     You saved me\175
======================================
Box 3543
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     What about the others?
======================================
Box 3544
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Why didn't you save them?
======================================
Box 3545
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Why me?
======================================
Box 3546
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     There they are!
======================================
Box 3547
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     Stand back.
======================================
Box 3548
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     There, that is the last of them.
======================================
Box 3549
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     What was that?
======================================
Box 3550
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     Monsters. No one knows where
they came from.
======================================
Box 3551
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     I have been assigned the
responsibility of protecting everyone
here.
======================================
Box 3552
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Does that mean\175
======================================
Box 3553
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     Yes, you will be protectors as
well.
======================================
Box 3554
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     The time has come for you to make
use of the talents and skills given
to you.
======================================
Box 3555
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     There have been reports of
increasing monster activity all
across the land.
======================================
Box 3556
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     I have been instructed to
complete your training with haste, so
that each of you may be assigned a
town, to defend the defenseless.
======================================
Box 3557
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     I will provide you with support
by training more people, and by having
icons crafted for everyone who needs
them.
======================================
Box 3558
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     You will become heroes. The
people will sing praises to your name,
and they will tell stories about you
just like they do for the valorians.
======================================
Box 3559
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     Remember this day, it is the day
the people of this land placed all
their hopes and dreams into each one
of you.
======================================
Box 3560
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     You shall be their highest
desires. If you fail, they fail.
======================================
Box 3561
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     We won't fail you!
======================================
Box 3562
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     Good.
======================================
Box 3563
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     You will do your best, that is
all that can be expected of you.
======================================
Box 3564
--------------------------------------
[\210 Master]
     We will see if that will be good
enough.
======================================
Box 3565
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Wakeup.
======================================
Box 3566
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Why do you oversleep so much?
======================================
Box 3567
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I had a bad dream.
======================================
Box 3568
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I never really have dreams when
I sleep.
======================================
Box 3569
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What I have are more like
memories, things over and done with
that no one can change.
======================================
Box 3570
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     That's what I have too. Dream
is a bad word for it.
======================================
Box 3571
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Do you ever have any real dreams?
======================================
Box 3572
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes, but only when I am awake.
======================================
Box 3573
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Me too. Dreaming is too important
to do in your sleep.
======================================
Box 3574
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Come on, they are waiting for us
downstairs.
======================================
Box 3575
--------------------------------------
[\229 ${H10}]
     Hey Dogero!
======================================
Box 3576
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What took you so long?
======================================
Box 3577
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We're here, aren't we? That's
all that matters.
======================================
Box 3578
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     The valorian icons are not
responding.
======================================
Box 3579
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What do you mean?
======================================
Box 3580
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     They are not taking form like
Fedora's did.
======================================
Box 3581
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Anon's and Gitleh's have taken
form before.
======================================
Box 3582
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Shoda's hasn't.
======================================
Box 3583
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     They will come to our aid as
promised. They are our best chance
to defeat him.
======================================
Box 3584
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I do not like this chance.
======================================
Box 3585
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     It is not in our favor, and it is
not in our control beyond getting them
there.
======================================
Box 3586
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     At least it is something.
======================================
Box 3587
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You don't think we could take
Gahn by ourselves?
======================================
Box 3588
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No.
======================================
Box 3589
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I have been skeptical of that as
well. I cannot see us defeating him,
though I want to more than anything.
======================================
Box 3590
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What about you, Mi'la?
======================================
Box 3591
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     If the valorians fight him,
I won't stop them. It will be a
difficult fight either way.
======================================
Box 3592
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     If anything, they could weaken
him enough for us to have a chance.
A very good chance.
======================================
Box 3593
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Good plan.
======================================
Box 3594
--------------------------------------
[\229 ${H10}]
     I hope it works for your sake.
If it doesn't, I don't think I will
ever see you guys again.
======================================
Box 3595
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We will be back. Don't worry
about us.
======================================
Box 3596
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Goodbye.
======================================
Box 3597
--------------------------------------
[\229 ${H10}]
     Goodbye.
======================================
Box 3598
--------------------------------------
[\229 ${H10}]
     Please come back alive.
======================================
Box 3599
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Do you remember where Grinlow
Spiral is?
======================================
Box 3600
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes.
======================================
Box 3601
--------------------------------------

     It is south of Fralin\175
======================================
Box 3602
--------------------------------------

     South through the Forest Pass\175
======================================
Box 3603
--------------------------------------

     There is a point where we should
turn west\175
======================================
Box 3604
--------------------------------------

     And we should find a dirt path
leading directly into it.
======================================
Box 3605
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You're not afraid, are you?
======================================
Box 3606
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It has been a long time since
I was last there.
======================================
Box 3607
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's finish this.
======================================
Box 3608
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Stop!
======================================
Box 3609
--------------------------------------
[\239 ????]
     I see more protectors have come.
No, you don't look like the rest of
them. There is something different
about you.
======================================
Box 3610
--------------------------------------
[\239 ????]
     Perhaps it is the way you carry
yourselves. Yes, that's it.
======================================
Box 3611
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What are you babbling about?
======================================
Box 3612
--------------------------------------
[\239 ????]
     My apologies, allow me to
introduce myself. I am Skyler the
historian.
======================================
Box 3613
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     I have been studying Grinlow
Spiral for many seasons. It is a
fascinating place, in fact, something
interesting has been going on lately.
======================================
Box 3614
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Continue.
======================================
Box 3615
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     Worn out protectors, the likes
of which I have never seen before,
have been wandering in from all across
the land.
======================================
Box 3616
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     They have set up a crude camp
in the dead forest below Grinlow.
All they do is mope around all day{}
======================================
Box 3617
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     Did you know that the dead forest
is dead due to the Spiral? It is a
gigantic mountain, one cannot tell
time under its shadow{}
======================================
Box 3618
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Blah, blah, why have the
protectors come here?
======================================
Box 3619
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     No need to be rude.
======================================
Box 3620
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     The protectors have come here
because they have quit.
======================================
Box 3621
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     They quit?
======================================
Box 3622
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     Yes, that is what I said,
didn't I?
======================================
Box 3623
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     They have had a calling here, by
some unknown force. This is a
gathering of Gahn's faithful.
======================================
Box 3624
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     Well, more like his once
faithful. They are all burnt out,
you see\175
======================================
Box 3625
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Thank you for the information.
We have business within Grinlow,
excuse us.
======================================
Box 3626
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     It was nice talking with you.
======================================
Box 3627
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     Wait! You can't go inside
Grinlow!
======================================
Box 3628
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     Wait!
======================================
Box 3629
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     You can't go in there! Are you
crazy?
======================================
Box 3630
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No, we are not.
======================================
Box 3631
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     I cannot allow you to kill
yourselves.
======================================
Box 3632
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What are you doing? You stupid
fool!
======================================
Box 3633
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     You do not know what is up there,
you cannot possibly imagine{}
======================================
Box 3634
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I've been there before. Step
aside.
======================================
Box 3635
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     That place contains a great evil,
it is the birthplace and castle of
Grinlow himself!
======================================
Box 3636
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     Grinlow, the destroyer of light,
the eater of souls{}I have reason to
believe he has risen again, the signs
are everywhere\175
======================================
Box 3637
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     The protectors gathering, the
suffering in the land, the influx of
monsters; there has been so much pain,
it can only mean his return.
======================================
Box 3638
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We are going in there.
======================================
Box 3639
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     I can't even open the main gate!
I have tried and tried, but it is
hopeless.
======================================
Box 3640
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We do not try. Trying denotes
failure in action.
======================================
Box 3641
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Just because you have failed does
not mean we will. You have had your
chance, now step aside.
======================================
Box 3642
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     You will have to kill me!
======================================
Box 3643
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Get out of my way.
======================================
Box 3644
--------------------------------------
[\239 Skyler]
     There is something unnatural
about you\175
======================================
Box 3645
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Dogero, you glowed.
======================================
Box 3646
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I have never felt more alive in
my entire life.
======================================
Box 3647
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I felt it within, I didn't know
it would show on the outside.
======================================
Box 3648
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I feel like I have enough energy
to do anything. I feel unstoppable.
======================================
Box 3649
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     There will be no more regrets
from this moment on. Are you ready?
======================================
Box 3650
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     We have come this far, and we
haven't turned back yet.
======================================
Box 3651
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I am ready.
======================================
Box 3652
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     So this is it.
======================================
Box 3653
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I always dreamed I would come
this far, and I am here.
======================================
Box 3654
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     My resolve is firm. I am ready.
======================================
Box 3655
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I'm always ready.
======================================
Box 3656
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I know I have seemed harsh at
times, but I want you all to realize
that I care about you. You are the
only allies I have.
======================================
Box 3657
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Therefore, none of you are
allowed to die. So don't.
======================================
Box 3658
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     The source of all the trouble in
the land is somewhere in that
mountain. I know it is.
======================================
Box 3659
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Whatever happens, we know we were
right to come here. There is no
turning back once our direction is
set.
======================================
Box 3660
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We are going to end this by our
own hands.
======================================
Box 3661
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's go.
======================================
Box 3662
--------------------------------------
     Enter by my will and no other.
======================================
Box 3663
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Are you okay?
======================================
Box 3664
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I just need a moment.
======================================
Box 3665
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We can't hesitate once we are
inside. If we do, we could die.
======================================
Box 3666
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Being in the very presence of
this place would be enough to
overwhelm any normal person.
======================================
Box 3667
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Good thing we aren't normal. The
most it can do to us is make us pause
long enough to summon more courage.
======================================
Box 3668
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Or maybe we are normal.
======================================
Box 3669
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     What standard of normal have we
been using? The standard of majority.
The majority defines what is common,
not what is normal.
======================================
Box 3670
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I understand now, I finally
understand. I feel like a great burden
has been lifted off of my back.
======================================
Box 3671
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I have been allowing others to
define what is normal for me.
======================================
Box 3672
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Each of us defines our own
standard, and that is the norm.
======================================
Box 3673
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Unlike the poor souls we have
crossed paths with who have given up
on life, we have set our standards
high.
======================================
Box 3674
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I was once one of them, but not
anymore. I have reclaimed my mind.
======================================
Box 3675
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Gahn does not stand a chance
against us.
======================================
Box 3676
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I hope you're right about that
last part.
======================================
Box 3677
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I know what happened here has
been troubling you, Dogero.
======================================
Box 3678
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     That happened a long time ago,
it is over and done with.
======================================
Box 3679
--------------------------------------

     You can't change the past, but
you can look into the present. We are
with you, you are stronger{}you have
no reason to doubt yourself!
======================================
Box 3680
--------------------------------------

     There are those who live their
entire life never having fought to
defend what they believe in, never
having had to support their claims{}
======================================
Box 3681
--------------------------------------

     There are those who never have
had to stand up for themselves, there
are those who have hid from problems,
hoping their failures would go away{}
======================================
Box 3682
--------------------------------------

     And there are those who have
accepted their problems and live
miserable lives full of what-ifs and
sorrow.
======================================
Box 3683
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We are not those people.
======================================
Box 3684
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     This is the only way to live{}
with our sights set high and our feet
on the ground. We can do this.
======================================
Box 3685
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You can do this.
======================================
Box 3686
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I am ready.
======================================
Box 3687
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Nothing will stop me now.
======================================
Box 3688
--------------------------------------
     I congratulate you on coming
this far.
======================================
Box 3689
--------------------------------------
     Your quest approaches its end,
and like all ends, there will be new
beginnings.
======================================
Box 3690
--------------------------------------
     Riches, health, talents, and
opportunities are not equally divided
among men, but the gift of time is
the same to all.
======================================
Box 3691
--------------------------------------
     The most powerful man cannot be
granted an extra hour in the day.
======================================
Box 3692
--------------------------------------
     As time gives the tree a season
for growth, fruit, blossom, and rest,
so do I give you sufficient time for
your purpose.
======================================
Box 3693
--------------------------------------
     Time cannot be purchased, sold,
stored, nor cast away. It may bring
glory, it may bring shame. But in the
end it will serve my purpose.
======================================
Box 3694
--------------------------------------
     My purpose is everyone's purpose.
The sun's purpose to trees is like
mine unto yours.
======================================
Box 3695
--------------------------------------
     As the tree is bent, so shall the
tree grow. You have chosen to deny me,
yet your quest has served me well.
======================================
Box 3696
--------------------------------------
     Know that I will be waiting atop
the monument to your failure.
======================================
Box 3697
--------------------------------------
     Suffer to come to me.
======================================
Box 3698
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     We have to fight it!
======================================
Box 3699
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It stopped.
======================================
Box 3700
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     We have regained control of our
minds from him.
======================================
Box 3701
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What's the matter with you two?
======================================
Box 3702
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Nothing anymore.
======================================
Box 3703
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's finish this.
======================================
Box 3704
--------------------------------------
     No days are left for you.
======================================
Box 3705
--------------------------------------
     Your time has come to its end.
======================================
Box 3706
--------------------------------------
     Your life has been nothing more
than wishful thinking.
======================================
Box 3707
--------------------------------------
     Welcome to the end.
======================================
Box 3708
--------------------------------------
     Today is the day the world ends.
======================================
Box 3709
--------------------------------------
     All is hopeless.
======================================
Box 3710
--------------------------------------
     Prepare for complete abandonment.
======================================
Box 3711
--------------------------------------
     Nothing you do today will matter
tomorrow.
======================================
Box 3712
--------------------------------------
     The clouds have set in.
======================================
Box 3713
--------------------------------------
     All has become gray.
======================================
Box 3714
--------------------------------------
     Embrace the inevitable.
======================================
Box 3715
--------------------------------------
     0 days remain.
======================================
Box 3716
--------------------------------------
     Are you prepared to fade away?
======================================
Box 3717
--------------------------------------
     Your interest is counterfeit,
release it.
======================================
Box 3718
--------------------------------------
     Watch as the dream becomes the
nightmare.
======================================
Box 3719
--------------------------------------
     Do not waste your last day of
existence.
======================================
Box 3720
--------------------------------------
     Your aimless wandering has come
full circle.
======================================
Box 3721
--------------------------------------
     You still have today to
procrastinate.
======================================
Box 3722
--------------------------------------
     Sleep and watch your problems
disappear.
======================================
Box 3723
--------------------------------------
     Continue and witness the fall.
======================================
Box 3724
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Do you hear that?
======================================
Box 3725
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Don't tell me you're hearing
voices now.
======================================
Box 3726
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     It is coming from the next room.
======================================
Box 3727
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     It sounds awful\175
======================================
Box 3728
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     The moment we step through that
door, carnage will begin.
======================================
Box 3729
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Be ready for anything.
======================================
Box 3730
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     So. We meet again.
======================================
Box 3731
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     Vonnegut welcomes you to
nonexistence.
======================================
Box 3732
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     We are bugs in the amber of time,
this moment has already come to pass.
The outcome, decided. There is no why.
======================================
Box 3733
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     The black blade, an empty well.
It thirsts for the emptiness found
inside you.
======================================
Box 3734
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     It will hold nothing back.
======================================
Box 3735
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     Embrace the inherent defeat and
loss.
======================================
Box 3736
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     My blade\175
======================================
Box 3737
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     The room grows dark, Vonnegut.
Death is finally ours\175
======================================
Box 3738
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     We stood no chance against the
masters of time. So it goes.
======================================
Box 3739
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Manx, you're alive!
======================================
Box 3740
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Get out of here! I will take care
of him.
======================================
Box 3741
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I said get out of here! Hurry up
and defeat Gahn.
======================================
Box 3742
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Kill him for what he did to my
son!
======================================
Box 3743
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Manx\175
======================================
Box 3744
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     Ha-ha-ha\175
======================================
Box 3745
--------------------------------------
[\206 Rift]
     You can't kill what is already
dead, so it goes, so it goes\175
======================================
Box 3746
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Go!
======================================
Box 3747
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     You fools.
======================================
Box 3748
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     You were a fool to let me live.
======================================
Box 3749
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     Once again, many have suffered
because of your actions, just like
the suffering you caused by your
failure to kill Gahn.
======================================
Box 3750
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     There is only one failure in this
room, Lycant. I am looking at him.
======================================
Box 3751
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     I hate you!
======================================
Box 3752
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Your actions are not my fault,
I am not responsible for your
senselessness.
======================================
Box 3753
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     I hate everything you stand for!
======================================
Box 3754
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     You are to blame for what they
did to me! I will not allow any of
you fools to ridicule me with
impunity.
======================================
Box 3755
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     My suffering is your fault, it is
the fault of society! I cannot be held
responsible for what others have made
me into{}
======================================
Box 3756
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You allowed yourself to be
manipulated by others. You allowed
your mind to become Gahn's property.
======================================
Box 3757
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Do not stand before me and deny
the consequences of your actions{}
======================================
Box 3758
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Your actions! Not anyone else's.
======================================
Box 3759
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     No\175
======================================
Box 3760
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Not society's.
======================================
Box 3761
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     No!
======================================
Box 3762
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Not anyone's but your own.
======================================
Box 3763
--------------------------------------
[\218 Lycant]
     No! No! No!
======================================
Box 3764
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You got what you deserved. Now
it is time, once again, for you to
get yours.
======================================
Box 3765
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     Hello, hello.
======================================
Box 3766
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     Look at who has walked right into
our trap.
======================================
Box 3767
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     They are the ones who deny
illusions, yet what do they see before
them?
======================================
Box 3768
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     We could have been allies, but
you denied us, and in turn you denied
Gahn.
======================================
Box 3769
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     You look outward, neglecting what
is within.
======================================
Box 3770
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     It is unnatural for one to
believe they can truly know anything
with any amount of certainty. You do
not belong in our world.
======================================
Box 3771
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     But enough empty promises. Watch
the illusion as the illusion watches
you!
======================================
Box 3772
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     Prepare to be overwhelmed.
======================================
Box 3773
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Those weren't illusions. I could
see them with my glasses when I
entered.
======================================
Box 3774
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Why didn't you say something!
======================================
Box 3775
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I wanted Talvas to realize what
an absolute failure he is.
======================================
Box 3776
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     The champion of perception over
reality has been introduced to the
cold, hard ground in a completely
external manner.
======================================
Box 3777
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     He thought he could deceive us,
and I knew he couldn't. He hid himself
in an attempt to convince us that what
we saw was untrue.
======================================
Box 3778
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yet it was true. Reality exists,
and it is the same for everyone. It is
not a matter of opinion.
======================================
Box 3779
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     He was the only one here that was
in denial.
======================================
Box 3780
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Dogero! Look out!
======================================
Box 3781
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What a pathetic creature. Let's
go.
======================================
Box 3782
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     Ha-ha-ha\175
======================================
Box 3783
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     You can't kill me\175
======================================
Box 3784
--------------------------------------
[\207 Talvas]
     You only think you can.
======================================
Box 3785
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Mi'la\175
======================================
Box 3786
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Gahn!
======================================
Box 3787
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shoda]
     Stand down, Dogero. We shall
handle this.
======================================
Box 3788
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shoda]
     You have brought us here for one
purpose. Let us carry your quest to
its conclusion.
======================================
Box 3789
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shoda]
     It is our duty, our fight. You
have done well to get this far, we
shall take over from here.
======================================
Box 3790
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No!
======================================
Box 3791
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     At first, and for a long time,
I thought you were the only hope I
had; but now that I am here, I know
I can do this!
======================================
Box 3792
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Stand down, Dogero.
======================================
Box 3793
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Let them fulfill their promise.
======================================
Box 3794
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shoda]
     Gahn! You have defiled our tombs
and have brought evil back to this
land.
======================================
Box 3795
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shoda]
     We, the valorians who defeated
Grinlow, shall now defeat you.
======================================
Box 3796
--------------------------------------
[\225 Anon]
     It is time.
======================================
Box 3797
--------------------------------------
[\229 Gitleh]
     We are ready.
======================================
Box 3798
--------------------------------------
[\223 Fedora]
     That's it? That is the source?
I was expecting something fierce, not
something so restrained.
======================================
Box 3799
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     I am sorry to disappoint you.
======================================
Box 3800
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Be careful, he is more powerful
than he appears{}don't mistake his
self-control for modesty!
======================================
Box 3801
--------------------------------------
[\224 Shoda]
     Do not worry about us, we cannot
be defeated.
======================================
Box 3802
--------------------------------------

Box 3841
--------------------------------------

     You have witnessed the defeat of
the undefeatable.
======================================
Box 3842
--------------------------------------

     The legendary valorians,
worshipped as gods, now serve the
greater purpose, our purpose.
======================================
Box 3843
--------------------------------------

     What chance do you, four mortals
who act all too human, stand against
a dispatcher of the heroic and divine?
======================================
Box 3844
--------------------------------------

     I understand your predicament
and I feel deeply for you.
======================================
Box 3845
--------------------------------------

     You are caught between two
desires: one to defeat what you see
as the source of your misery, the
other being your fear of death.
======================================
Box 3846
--------------------------------------

     The latter of which you should
heed.
======================================
Box 3847
--------------------------------------

     There is no worth pursuing the
source, nor in seeking the fulfillment
of your dreams.
======================================
Box 3848
--------------------------------------

     What are dreams but self-
deception? They are not worth dying
over.
======================================
Box 3849
--------------------------------------

     I will give you a chance.
======================================
Box 3850
--------------------------------------

     Turn back now, and you will
receive my pardon. I will take mercy
upon your souls and spare you in the
final judgement.
======================================
Box 3851
--------------------------------------

     Chase me and dreams unattainable,
and die.
======================================
Box 3852

     The choice is yours. I have given
it to you.

======================================
Box 3855

     I don't want to give up, and I
don't want to die either.
======================================
Box 3856
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     This is a situation with no
correct answer. We cannot win like
this.
======================================
Box 3857
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You are right, we can't win if
you have already given up.
======================================
Box 3858
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You saw what he did.
======================================
Box 3859
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Whichever direction we choose,
we will have no regrets.
======================================
Box 3860
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Then there is only one direction
we should take.
======================================
Box 3861

[\202 Johan]
     I was afraid you'd say that.
======================================
Box 3862
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     This is the end, our next choice
will determine whose end.
======================================
Box 3863

[\201 Mi'la]
     You know which way to go.
======================================
Box 3864
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No regrets.
======================================
Box 3865
--------------------------------------
     I chose to walk away.
======================================
Box 3866
--------------------------------------
     I chose to live, or at least that
is what I said to myself.
======================================
Box 3867
--------------------------------------
     Sometimes I think about that day
as if it was the only day that ever
really took place in my life.
======================================
Box 3868
--------------------------------------
     Time has never stopped for me,
and I find it difficult to keep track
of things\175
======================================
Box 3869
--------------------------------------
     I often wonder what could have
happened.
======================================
Box 3870
--------------------------------------
     Could I have defeated him?
======================================
Box 3871
--------------------------------------
     I'll never know\175
======================================
Box 3872
--------------------------------------
     I should not have turned back.
======================================
Box 3873
--------------------------------------
              But I did.
======================================
Box 3874
--------------------------------------

     You should not have come.
======================================
Box 3875
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Neither should you, but we are
here. And that is all that matters.
======================================
Box 3876
--------------------------------------

     It is time for you to know to
whom you speak.
======================================
Box 3877
--------------------------------------

     Be still, and listen.
======================================
Box 3878
--------------------------------------
     I come from a land far across
the great water\175
======================================
Box 3879
--------------------------------------
     It was a land much like a prison
cell, full of people full of hate,
hate because their dreams were all
dying\175
======================================
Box 3880
--------------------------------------
     I discovered a way to communicate
directly to the mind. I had opened a
whole new frontier. I gave people a
new dream, a dream of hope\175
======================================
Box 3881
--------------------------------------
     Many people came to me in need
and want, and soon I had a strong
collective following until that day,
that dark and paradoxical day\175
======================================
Box 3882
--------------------------------------
     When confronted with their
values, when I had made for them the
means to achieve their highest and
most noble desires, to make their
dreams a reality{}
======================================
Box 3883
--------------------------------------
     Where before they could only wish
and pray to be one unified body of
glory and might, wanting to never feel
pain or suffering again\175
======================================
Box 3884
--------------------------------------
     I had achieved the means by
which we could all live in
solidarity{}complete unity in
opinion, feeling, and thought!
======================================
Box 3885
--------------------------------------
     And what did they do! Praise me?
Sing glory to my name?
======================================
Box 3886
--------------------------------------
     Did they drop to their knees in
thankfulness, sympathetic to me and
their vision made real?
======================================
Box 3887
--------------------------------------

     No.
======================================
Box 3888
--------------------------------------

     They rejected me.
======================================
Box 3889
--------------------------------------

     Those who preached selflessness
and compassion, that all life is
equal{}they stood against me, their
one dream, their destiny\175
======================================
Box 3890
--------------------------------------

     I was everything they had ever
wanted, and they threw me away like
garbage.
======================================
Box 3891
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     That is the nature of the
universe.
======================================
Box 3892
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     If I cannot succeed, no one can,
and no one will.
======================================
Box 3893
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You're wrong, Gahn. You are more
wrong than you can possibly imagine.
======================================
Box 3894
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     You were to be my avatars of
vengeance.
======================================
Box 3895
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     The people of this land will give
themselves to me, and together we will
absorb those that thought they could
brush me underneath the rug of time.
======================================
Box 3896
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     I have allowed you to come this
far to bring me the power of your
best.
======================================
Box 3897
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     The Valorians and I are one, you
do not stand a chance against us.
======================================
Box 3898
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We'll see about that.
======================================
Box 3899
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     You cannot defeat me, Dogero.
You realized that a long time ago.
Why the sudden surge of optimism?
======================================
Box 3900
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We're not afraid of you!
======================================
Box 3901
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     You should be.
======================================
Box 3902
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     In the larger scheme of things
your struggle is meaningless.
======================================
Box 3903
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     What have you brought me but
power? What have you brought
yourselves but pain and suffering?
======================================
Box 3904
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     In the larger scheme of things
we would have brought ourselves pain
and suffering by not fighting you.
======================================
Box 3905
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You cannot trick us!
======================================
Box 3906
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     I do not have to when you trick
yourselves with a false sense of
conviction.
======================================
Box 3907
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You failed before you had ever
begun.
======================================
Box 3908
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Your thoughts were swayed by what
others wanted; you denied your own
desires by seeking the desires of
those who denied you.
======================================
Box 3909
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You are wrong to think we will
allow you to destroy the minds of so
many innocent people!
======================================
Box 3910
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     A man's mind is his property,
and no one else's.
======================================
Box 3911
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You have been trespassing against
that which you do not own, the minds
of others{}
======================================
Box 3912
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     And we have come to put an end
to your madness!
======================================
Box 3913
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You have damned us all because
you have damned yourself.
======================================
Box 3914
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Instead of solving your problem
and correcting your failure, you have
set out to make it so no one can ever
achieve anything by their own will.
======================================
Box 3915
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We have never given up, and in
that respect alone we have already
defeated you.
======================================
Box 3916
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It is our resolve against yours{}
you cannot hope to win!
======================================
Box 3917
--------------------------------------

               Enough!
======================================
Box 3918
--------------------------------------

               Silence!
======================================
Box 3919
--------------------------------------

   Be still and know that I am Gahn!
======================================
Box 3920
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     You have lost.
======================================
Box 3921
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     Give up your hopeless struggle
against what you know deep down
inside to be true.
======================================
Box 3922
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     You shall not stand up this time,
Dogero.
======================================
Box 3923
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     You shall not.
======================================
Box 3924
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     We did it!
======================================
Box 3925
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     We defeated Gahn!
======================================
Box 3926
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     He is still alive.
======================================
Box 3927
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     That is easily fixed.
======================================
Box 3928
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Is something wrong?
======================================
Box 3929
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Why are you smiling?
======================================
Box 3930
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     My life is in my hands and no
one else's.
======================================
Box 3931
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Dogero! What are you doing?
======================================
Box 3932
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No! You fool!
======================================
Box 3933
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Don't you dare!
======================================

======================================

     Please, don't look at me like
that\175
======================================
Box 3936
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     He called me here, to renew my
life as a protector\175
======================================
Box 3937
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     He has ordered me to block you
from ascending.
======================================
Box 3938
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     And will you?
======================================
Box 3939
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     No, I will not.
======================================
Box 3940
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I saw what you did.
======================================
Box 3941
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     You have always liked her more
than me.
======================================
Box 3942
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I thought I could change that by
being the nicest person possible. Now
I understand how wrong I was to think
you would ever love someone like that.
======================================
Box 3943
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I tried to be someone I'm not for
people I only pretended to care about.
======================================
Box 3944
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I am tired of having broken
dreams and crushed hopes\175
======================================
Box 3945
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I have never hated you.
======================================
Box 3946
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I know.
======================================
Box 3947
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     The world is a wonderful place,
and I am ready to live in it.
======================================
Box 3948

[\200 Dogero]
     Katina\175
======================================
Box 3949
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Don't waste your time with me,
you have something great to
accomplish!
======================================
Box 3950
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     You have shown me that he can be
defeated.
======================================
Box 3951
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Thank you.
======================================
Box 3952
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Ha-ha! Don't thank me, I'm the
one who's supposed to be thanking you!
======================================
Box 3953
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Thank you for saving me, Dogero.
======================================
Box 3954
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I didn't save you, you saved
yourself.
======================================
Box 3955
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     I love you.
======================================
Box 3956
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Go get him!
======================================
Box 3957
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     There is only one person left
in your way\175 be careful, Dogero.
When this is over, I want to see you
again.
======================================
Box 3958
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Did you think I'd let you face
him alone?
======================================
Box 3959
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I am glad you chose to live.
======================================
Box 3960
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Yeah, well don't celebrate just
yet. He's still alive.
======================================
Box 3961
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I fought him for as long as I
could, but I couldn't stop him from
making it to the top. He's up there
waiting for us.
======================================
Box 3962
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I remember the last time we went
through this\175
======================================
Box 3963
--------------------------------------

     I couldn't move.
======================================
Box 3964
--------------------------------------

     There was nothing I could do.
======================================
Box 3965
--------------------------------------

     That is why he chose me. That is
why I passed his training.
======================================
Box 3966
--------------------------------------

     I didn't do anything.
======================================
Box 3967
--------------------------------------

     I gave up.
======================================
Box 3968
--------------------------------------

     I was the only one out of the
four of us who gave up\175 on living,
on life\175 and somehow he was able to
see that.
======================================
Box 3969
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     I am not going to make that same
mistake.
======================================
Box 3970
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You haven't.
======================================
Box 3971
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     We will win this time.
======================================
Box 3972
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Because we won't give up.
======================================
Box 3973
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     He doesn't stand a chance against
us!
======================================
Box 3974
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     You are hurt\175
======================================
Box 3975
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     So are you.
======================================
Box 3976
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     \175and you are weak, yet you have
chosen to chase after me\175 alone?
======================================
Box 3977
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     \175and you are weak, yet you and
Dart have chosen to chase after me?
======================================
Box 3978
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     You cannot defeat me, you cannot\175
======================================
Box 3979
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     You cannot!
======================================
Box 3980
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What makes you so sure about
that?
======================================
Box 3981
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     You don't have the jade sword.
======================================
Box 3982
--------------------------------------

     I don't need that to defeat you.
======================================
Box 3983
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     All I need is my life and nothing
more.
======================================
Box 3984
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No flashy sword.
======================================
Box 3985
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No valorian gods to help me.
======================================
Box 3986
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No icons.
======================================
Box 3987
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No allies.
======================================
Box 3988
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Nothing but my own will.
======================================
Box 3989
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     No\175
======================================
Box 3990
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     What have you become?
======================================
Box 3991
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     Stay away from me!
======================================
Box 3992
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     No, you can't possibly mean to\175
======================================
Box 3993
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes.
======================================
Box 3994
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     This is going to end right now,
and I will be the one who ends it.
======================================
Box 3995
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     He isn't worth it.
======================================
Box 3996
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     You can't win if you die!
======================================
Box 3997
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Tell them I was in complete
control of my actions.
======================================
Box 3998
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Tell them I did this for myself.
======================================
Box 3999
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Dogero, you don't have to do
this\175
======================================
Box 4000
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     You don't have to do this\175
======================================
Box 4001
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I don't have to, but I am.
======================================
Box 4002
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Do you hear me Gahn!
======================================
Box 4003
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I am!
======================================
Box 4004
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     You are hurt.
======================================
Box 4005
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     So are you.
======================================
Box 4006
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     \175and you are weak, yet you have
chosen to chase me\175 alone?
======================================
Box 4007
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     \175and you are weak, yet you and
Dart have chosen to chase after me?
======================================
Box 4008
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     You cannot defeat me\175
======================================
Box 4009
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     You cannot!
======================================
Box 4010
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What makes you so sure about
that?
======================================
Box 4011
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     You forget, Dogero\175
======================================
Box 4012
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     Things will be things and people
will be people.
======================================
Box 4013
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     Losers will be losers and winners
will be winners.
======================================
Box 4014
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     Unity will always be the
solution, and you will always be the
problem.
======================================
Box 4015
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     That is not true.
======================================
Box 4016
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     There exist certain truths you
cannot change.
======================================
Box 4017
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     That is called the past,
everything else is game.
======================================
Box 4018
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     But the law of the universe is
the law of the universe.
======================================
Box 4019
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     We all fail{}suffering is our
only guarantee in this life, death
our ultimate end.
======================================
Box 4020
--------------------------------------

     Once a man fails, you can label
him as hopeless. That means his dreams
are never to be realized. His fate has
become sealed.
======================================
Box 4021
--------------------------------------

     Our mistakes are written in
stone, our lives written in water{}
======================================
Box 4022
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     That is the message I have
brought to your land, that is the
dream I have made real!
======================================
Box 4023
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     The harmony you have in mind is
no harmony at all.
======================================
Box 4024
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Stop clouding your aim, stop
mystifying man's desire, stop
confusing yourself{}call your dream
what it is!
======================================
Box 4025
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     And what is it, dog?
======================================
Box 4026
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It is nothing more than slavery.
======================================
Box 4027
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     We are slaves to the laws of the
universe{}
======================================
Box 4028
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We are not slaves to reality!
======================================
Box 4029
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     We are all slaves, Dogero, slaves
and masters, animals and men, subjects
under the rule of time.
======================================
Box 4030
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     You cannot defeat me with words
or weapons, nothing you can do can
stop me, because nothing you can do
can stop time!
======================================
Box 4031
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You are right.
======================================
Box 4032
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You are more right than you know.
======================================
Box 4033
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     You cannot defeat me\175
======================================
Box 4034
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I cannot defeat one who has
already been defeated.
======================================
Box 4035
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     You cannot\175
======================================
Box 4036
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I cannot change what already is;
that is the law of the universe,
isn't it?
======================================
Box 4037
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You have embraced your self-
determined shortcomings, you have
accepted failures as unalterable,
you have given up on life\175
======================================
Box 4038
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You have already lost a long
time ago. You have sealed your own
fate.
======================================
Box 4039
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It is time for you to suffer
that which you have sought.
======================================
Box 4040
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     What do you hope to accomplish
with that blade?
======================================
Box 4041
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     Have you forgotten what happened
the last time you used it?
======================================
Box 4042
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I finally understand the nature
of the sword of jade.
======================================
Box 4043
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You don't stand a chance.
======================================
Box 4044
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     So the slave thinks he is ready
to surpass his master, does he?
======================================
Box 4045
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     So be it!
======================================
Box 4046
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     Come, show me true jade!
======================================
Box 4047
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     I\175
======================================
Box 4048
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     I cannot get up.
======================================
Box 4049
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     This cannot be\175
======================================
Box 4050
--------------------------------------

     Why should we waste what little
time we have in conflict, when instead
we could live in harmony?
======================================
Box 4051
--------------------------------------
     There was nothing wrong with his
arms or hands.
======================================
Box 4052
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Dogero, get up.
======================================
Box 4053
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Dogero\175
======================================
Box 4054
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What a fool!
======================================
Box 4055
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Moron!
======================================
Box 4056
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Imbecile!
======================================
Box 4057
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You don't mean that, Mi'la.
======================================
Box 4058
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Get that door open, now!
======================================
Box 4059
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     It is locked from within.
======================================
Box 4060
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     He's in trouble, I know it.
======================================
Box 4061
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     He is always in some kind of
trouble.
======================================
Box 4062
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     And I\175
======================================
Box 4063
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     His life is his own to do what
he pleases with. You knew that going
into your relationship with him.
======================================
Box 4064
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You have to let go.
======================================
Box 4065
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Freedom is something Gahn could
never understand. It allows one to
act on their own will. Nothing is
more selfish.
======================================
Box 4066
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Hey.
======================================
Box 4067
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You are hurt.
======================================
Box 4068
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I'll manage.
======================================
Box 4069
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     That guy had a lot of fight in
him.
======================================
Box 4070
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     When it came right down to it,
and his life was on the line, he
opened his eyes for what seemed like
the first time in his life.
======================================
Box 4071
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     He didn't understand what he
was feeling. He hesitated, and that
was that.
======================================
Box 4072
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I'm glad you turned out okay.
======================================
Box 4073
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Me too.
======================================
Box 4074
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I want to see Dogero.
======================================
Box 4075
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     So do we.
======================================
Box 4076
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Wait, I can hear something from
the other side\175
======================================
Box 4077
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Stand back, it could be Gahn.
======================================
Box 4078
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     He has done it!
======================================
Box 4079
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Dogero has defeated the
undefeatable!
======================================
Box 4080
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Hurry, go see for yourselves
with your own eyes.
======================================
Box 4081
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Don't die.
======================================
Box 4082
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     You have to get up and finish
him.
======================================
Box 4083
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I can't\175
======================================
Box 4084
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Don't say that!
======================================
Box 4085
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     This is it, it is now or never!
======================================
Box 4086
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I\175
======================================
Box 4087
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Dogero!
======================================
Box 4088
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Stand back.
======================================
Box 4089
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What are you doing?
======================================
Box 4090
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I am finishing this.
======================================
Box 4091
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     Don't get near him!
======================================
Box 4092
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What is he doing?
======================================
Box 4093
--------------------------------------
[\209 Dart]
     He's taking control of his
destiny.
======================================
Box 4094
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     You cannot defeat me\175
======================================
Box 4095
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     You cannot stop the inevitable!
======================================
Box 4096
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     What I stand for, those who
believe in me\175
======================================
Box 4097
--------------------------------------
[\210 Gahn]
     I can never go away.
======================================
Box 4098
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I must use the sword, there is no
other way\175
======================================
Box 4099
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Don't do it{}let us help you!
======================================
Box 4100
--------------------------------------

     You have forced me to use the
sword, and so I shall.
======================================
Box 4101
--------------------------------------

     It is the only thing that can
hurt you.
======================================
Box 4102
--------------------------------------

     But it also hurts me\175
======================================
Box 4103
--------------------------------------

     If I go down, you go down.
======================================
Box 4104
--------------------------------------

     Don't throw your life away for
me. I am not worth it.
======================================
Box 4105
--------------------------------------

     I'm not throwing it away.
======================================
Box 4106
--------------------------------------

     I am not doing this for you.
======================================
Box 4107
--------------------------------------

     I am doing this for me!
======================================
Box 4108
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Dogero, your wounds\175
======================================
Box 4109
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     They are scars from using the
sword.
======================================
Box 4110
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It drains my life, I finally
figured it out{}
======================================
Box 4111
--------------------------------------

     It almost killed me the first
time I unlocked its full potential.
======================================
Box 4112
--------------------------------------

     This time, I could take it, and
a lot more.
======================================
Box 4113
--------------------------------------

     But it seems I have found my
limit.
======================================
Box 4114
--------------------------------------

     At least it surpassed his.
I can die happy.
======================================
Box 4115
--------------------------------------

     No regrets, Mi'la.
======================================
Box 4116
--------------------------------------

     No, you are not going to die!
======================================
Box 4117
--------------------------------------

     So don't talk like you are!
======================================
Box 4118
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Gahn is dead!
======================================
Box 4119
--------------------------------------
[\212 Katina]
     Gahn is dead!
======================================
Box 4120
--------------------------------------

     Dogero has defeated Gahn!
======================================
Box 4121
--------------------------------------

     The master to whom we have all
been slaves has been defeated, his
reign over us has been eliminated!
======================================
Box 4122
--------------------------------------

     Do you all not feel a great
burden lifted from your backs and
minds?
======================================
Box 4123
--------------------------------------

     That feeling you now feel is
freedom.
======================================
Box 4124
--------------------------------------

     Things are no longer cloudy and
gray, but black and white{}
======================================
Box 4125
--------------------------------------

     And red and blue and green and
all the colors you could ever dream
to see!
======================================
Box 4126
--------------------------------------

     The nightmare is over, it is
finally over; we don't have to live
in fear and dependence any longer.
======================================
Box 4127
--------------------------------------

     We are free to live our own
lives, to make our own decisions as
we please.
======================================
Box 4128
--------------------------------------

     There has been a great clash
of dreams atop that mountain, both
wanting to become real, and both
knowing only one could win.
======================================
Box 4129
--------------------------------------

     Two men have fought, and one has
won.
======================================
Box 4130
--------------------------------------

     One declared success as something
that cannot be had, and one has won.
======================================
Box 4131
--------------------------------------

     One failed in his actions and in
turn despised existence, and one has
won.
======================================
Box 4132
--------------------------------------

     One has won!
======================================
Box 4133
--------------------------------------

     Come with me and see for
yourself!
======================================
Box 4134
--------------------------------------
     I walked back a hero that day.
======================================
Box 4135
--------------------------------------
     I felt different as people gave
me their blessings\175
======================================
Box 4136
--------------------------------------
     I would often look at Johan,
Pyrus, and Mi'la as they looked back
at me. I wanted to thank them, but
they wouldn't let me.
======================================
Box 4137
--------------------------------------
     I knew my time was limited then,
and now I do not feel as if I have
much longer\175
======================================
Box 4138
--------------------------------------
     The wounds I suffered by using
the sword of jade have finally caught
up with me.
======================================
Box 4139
--------------------------------------
     I didn't choose to die, I chose
to live. It was something I had to do,
I and no one else.
======================================
Box 4140
--------------------------------------
     I hope they will understand.
======================================
Box 4141
--------------------------------------
     Johan lives with Mazing in Cyport
now.
======================================
Box 4142
--------------------------------------
     I often wonder why it feels so
right to see them together. They are
both talented and beautiful.
======================================
Box 4143
--------------------------------------
     I know they will go on to make
many great things, and go on many
great adventures.
======================================
Box 4144
--------------------------------------
     They visit often and for days.
I am always happy to see them.
======================================
Box 4145
--------------------------------------
     After staying with me and Mi'la
for awhile, Pyrus headed out to old
Keltan, to reclaim it.
======================================
Box 4146
--------------------------------------
     No one has heard from him since.
======================================
Box 4147
--------------------------------------
     The last thing he said to me
before he left was that he finally
understood the nature of dreams.
======================================
Box 4148
--------------------------------------
     I am sure he will succeed at
whatever he sets out to do.
======================================
Box 4149
--------------------------------------
     Shortly after I defeated Gahn,
Scarf showed up, alive.
======================================
Box 4150
--------------------------------------
     Manx found him and they decided
to work together, fighting what is
left of the monsters{}for a price,
of course.
======================================
Box 4151
--------------------------------------
     I am glad they have become
themselves again.
======================================
Box 4152
--------------------------------------
     They often stop by to say hi.
======================================
Box 4153
--------------------------------------
     Katina took charge of the
remaining protectors.
======================================
Box 4154
--------------------------------------
     She had thrown out the old order,
and has remade it into something
acceptable.
======================================
Box 4155
--------------------------------------
     They are now the defenders of
value, not the protectors of the
valueless.
======================================
Box 4156
--------------------------------------
     She too often visits from time
to time.
======================================
Box 4157
--------------------------------------
     I never saw Dart after that day.
======================================
Box 4158
--------------------------------------
     I am sure he is alive and well.
======================================
Box 4159
--------------------------------------
     He has finally become what he
has always wanted to be.
======================================
Box 4160
--------------------------------------
     I know he dislikes the
circumstances, and I would have liked
to have fought him for the title of
strongest, but I am in no condition
to do such.
======================================
Box 4161
--------------------------------------
     I am happy for him, even though
he probably isn't.
======================================
Box 4162
--------------------------------------
     Mi'la hardly ever leaves my side.
======================================
Box 4163
--------------------------------------
     Though she hasn't said so, I
think she has accepted what I did.
======================================
Box 4164
--------------------------------------
     I did not want to see her live
in a world ruled by Gahn's dream.
======================================
Box 4165
--------------------------------------
     I hope I can live long enough
to see our child\175
======================================

     It saddens me to think the child
may never know me, nor I the child.

mother one could have, which eases
my thoughts a bit\175
======================================
Box 4168
--------------------------------------
     I know she would yell at me for
thinking this way, but I will miss
her. I will miss her more than anyone.
======================================
Box 4169
--------------------------------------
     All I have to do to remind
myself that all of this was for the
best, is to be with her.
======================================
Box 4170
--------------------------------------
     My actions have profited me more
than I ever dreamed they would.
======================================
Box 4171
--------------------------------------
     It was because of the choices
I made that I have been able to enjoy
what I have enjoyed in my last days.
======================================
Box 4172

     As I look back on it all, I
understand how right she was.

[\201 Mi'la]
     I like the look of the sky.
======================================
Box 4194
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It goes on forever\175
======================================
Box 4195
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I figured it out.
======================================
Box 4196
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What?
======================================
Box 4197
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I finally figured it out.
======================================
Box 4198
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What are you talking about?
======================================
Box 4199
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     The difference between us and
those we fought; what we were fighting
to defend, and what we were fighting
against!
======================================
Box 4200
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I understand now, enough to
explain in detail. Though, I'm sure
you already know all of this.
======================================
Box 4201
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Go ahead.
======================================
Box 4202
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We sought to gain value, they
sought to avoid it.
======================================
Box 4203
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We wanted to accomplish goals,
they wanted to evade failure.
======================================
Box 4204
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We fought for our own gain and
happiness, they fought to escape
misery and suffering!
======================================
Box 4205
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What exactly is the difference
between the two?
======================================
Box 4206
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Isn't achieving happiness the
same as avoiding unhappiness?
======================================
Box 4207
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     If your only reason to go on
living is due to a fear of death,
then life isn't your aim: avoiding
death is.
======================================
Box 4208
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No happiness can come from that,
because you won't be working to gain
value, but to avoid it.
======================================
Box 4209
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     And when something good does
happen, you would be weary of it{}
you would call it luck, treat it as
unnatural, it wouldn't bring you any
happiness.
======================================
Box 4210
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Life is worth living.
======================================
Box 4211
--------------------------------------

     I don't care about the pain the
sword caused, I don't care how much
longer I have to avoid death{}

that can be had here.

     Don't you want more leisure and
less greed as does every idealist
crusader?
======================================
Box 4244

[\211 ????]
     It is in our carefree idleness
that the truth behind existence is
shown.
======================================

     Why don't you dream beneath jaded
falls like the rest of us?
======================================

     The only real mistake is the one
from which we learn nothing.

he used to be.

wake up, it would be so easy to do\175
and it is for that reason alone that
I cannot.

     I am not a quitter, and I will
not go down without a fight. Not when
the stakes are so high.

     You will never get what you seek,
no blade can strike me down!

cannot take from that which you cannot
kill.

have it all, I don't care. The most
important part is still mine and will
always be mine.

     Let's get out of here.
======================================
Box 4268
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     Oh, hello there.
======================================
Box 4269
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     If you plan to travel any
further, would it be okay if I join
you? I want to make it to the other
side.
======================================
Box 4270
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     The other side?
======================================
Box 4271
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What other side?
======================================
Box 4272
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     There's another side to reach?
======================================
Box 4273
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     The other side?
======================================
Box 4274
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     Yes, the other side. I have heard
stories of a ruined city existing
around here, the site of the true
battle between the valorians and Grin.
======================================
Box 4275
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     I believe this is the network
of caves that lead to it.
======================================
Box 4276
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     I must go there. May I accompany
you?
======================================
Box 4277
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Okay.
======================================
Box 4278
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You can tag along.
======================================
Box 4279

[\202 Johan]
     I don't see any reason why you
can't.
======================================
Box 4280
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You may.
======================================
Box 4281
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No.
======================================
Box 4282
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No.
======================================
Box 4283
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Sorry.
======================================
Box 4284
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Perhaps some other time.
======================================
Box 4285
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     Excellent, I will try and stay
out of your way{}I am too weak to be
of much help in combat.
======================================
Box 4286
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     I will wait in here, it is too
cold outside.
======================================
Box 4287
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     We've made it! This is it, this
has to be it.
======================================
Box 4288
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     A dreamer is the only one who can
find his way when night engulfs the
rest of the world, and his punishment
is that he is first to see the dawn.
======================================
Box 4289
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What are you talking about?
======================================
Box 4290
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     Oh, nothing, I have a bad habit
of talking to myself.
======================================
Box 4291
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Hmm\175
======================================
Box 4292
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     So, this is the true battle-
ground of the Valorians and Grinlow?
======================================
Box 4293
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     I think so, only one way to find
out for sure. Let's explore it.
======================================
Box 4294
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Wait a moment.
======================================
Box 4295
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     Huh?
======================================
Box 4296
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Of what interest are these ruins
to you?
======================================
Box 4297
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     They're ancient ruins, how could
anyone not be interested? This is the
place of legends.
======================================
Box 4298
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     The event that ended the time of
suffering, the victory that caused a
ray of hope in a land clouded by
misery and despair\175
======================================
Box 4299
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     The act that changed the world,
that made it a place worth living in
again\175
======================================
Box 4300
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     It all took place here.
======================================
Box 4301
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     This is the landmark of the
rebirth of civilization. If the
valorians had lost here, we would
be living in holes like animals.
======================================
Box 4302
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I may end up liking this place.
======================================
Box 4303
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yeah, I never knew that this
place actually exists{}and to think
we are the first to find it!
======================================
Box 4304
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     There's something wrong about
this. I don't like it.
======================================
Box 4305
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     There is nothing wrong, it is a
glorious place. Let's have a look
around and see what we can find.
======================================
Box 4306
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I have a bad feeling about this
place.
======================================
Box 4307
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Dogero\175
======================================
Box 4308
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Perhaps it is nothing.
======================================
Box 4309
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Don't say that, your feelings
have been right before and I don't
like this place either. What made
you say that?
======================================
Box 4310
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Well, this place doesn't seem
right. Why has no one else found it
yet? We can't be the first.
======================================
Box 4311
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     Perhaps people have and have
never bothered to tell anyone.
======================================
Box 4312
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Or perhaps there is something
here that has killed them, or
something that has never allowed them
to return.
======================================
Box 4313
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Or maybe we really are the first
and we're going to find lots of
treasure!
======================================
Box 4314
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     Either way, we should continue
exploring.
======================================
Box 4315
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Hmm.
======================================
Box 4316
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What are you hmm-ing about?
======================================
Box 4317
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     These ruins\175 what was this place?
======================================
Box 4318
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     A large city, obviously.
======================================
Box 4319
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I mean, why is it in ruins? If
the Valorians defeated Grinlow here,
should not this city still exist
today?
======================================
Box 4320
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Even if the city ceased to be,
should not there be some kind of
monument established to mark the
event, as was the ancient custom?
======================================
Box 4321
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I don't see any monument.
======================================
Box 4322
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     Who knows? Maybe these ruins are
the monument. The battle must have
destroyed this place; maybe no one
wanted to rebuild it.
======================================
Box 4323
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Perhaps.
======================================
Box 4324
--------------------------------------

     It would be more like a tombstone
or warning rather than a monument,
if so.
======================================
Box 4325
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     We won't discover the truth if
we keep stopping like this. We can
discuss this once we have searched
the ruins in full.
======================================
Box 4326
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What in the world is that!
======================================
Box 4327
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Don't get near it, you fool!
======================================
Box 4328
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     This must be\175 but it can't be.
This doesn't make any sense.
======================================
Box 4329
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     Beautiful, what a find!
======================================
Box 4330
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     Do any of you realize what this
is?
======================================
Box 4331
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     These are the remains of
Grinlow{}the king of demons, devourer
of light, the butcher of sanity
himself!
======================================
Box 4332
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What do you plan to do with it?
======================================
Box 4333
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     What? Me?
======================================
Box 4334
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     Hahaha!
======================================
Box 4335
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!
======================================
Box 4336
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Answer me, Scarf!
======================================
Box 4337
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     So, you knew all along, did you?
======================================
Box 4338
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Well it is too late for you and
this world. This world was doomed
from the beginning.
======================================
Box 4339
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     We were all doomed from the
beginnings: birth, consciousness,
conceptuality\175
======================================
Box 4340
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Only the doomed say things like
that.
======================================
Box 4341
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     And we are all doomed!
======================================
Box 4342
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Life is suffering, and I will be
the one to put an end to the
collective misfortune of mankind!
======================================
Box 4343
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     He's mad\175
======================================
Box 4344
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Don't do this, Scarf, you're
better than this!
======================================
Box 4345
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     How can I be? I can be no better
than nothing.
======================================
Box 4346
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You are not being you. You have
allowed something to change you, and
whatever it is, we will destroy it.
======================================
Box 4347
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Ha-ha-ha-ha!
======================================
Box 4348
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Do not fear death, embrace it!
======================================
Box 4349
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Grinlow will once again act as
the hands of doom, reaching out upon
the lands in one loving embrace,
crushing all that is alive and weak.
======================================
Box 4350
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     And those who run will know pain.
I will be the one to end it! None of
you will be left alive!
======================================
Box 4351
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Witness firsthand the paradox of
existence: death is life!
======================================
Box 4352
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     No\175
======================================
Box 4353
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     This isn't fair\175
======================================
Box 4354
--------------------------------------
        \169 Acquired \178 Pommel \169
======================================
Box 4355
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     No\175 I need it\175 don't take it
away from me\175
======================================
Box 4356
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Scarf, stand up.
======================================
Box 4357
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     I can't\175
======================================
Box 4358
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Stand up!
======================================
Box 4359
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You can stand on your own.
======================================
Box 4360
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It has been holding you down.
You do not need it.
======================================
Box 4361
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Gahn, please, give me strength\175
======================================
Box 4362
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     I'm too weak to stand on my own\175
too feeble a creature, too stupid to
figure out why I can't win.
======================================
Box 4363
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     Once I imagined I would come out
on top, what seems like an eternity
ago\175
======================================
Box 4364
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     But I have since then lost any
semblance of hope, fear and failure
have erased it.
======================================
Box 4365
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     I have been fighting this demon
ever since that day on Grinlow\175
======================================
Box 4366
--------------------------------------

     We were winning, we came so far\175
======================================
Box 4367
--------------------------------------

     It was all for nothing.
======================================
Box 4368
--------------------------------------

     It would have been nice to have
had a chance.
======================================
Box 4369
--------------------------------------

     We never had one.
======================================
Box 4370
--------------------------------------

     We were all doomed, and I was the
first to fall.
======================================
Box 4371
--------------------------------------

     When I woke up, I cringed in pain
realizing that I had only woken up
from a dream into a nightmare. I had
never been so cold in my entire life.
======================================
Box 4372
--------------------------------------

     All I could think about was that
green blade I saw. It was the one sure
way to end the unbearable pain I felt\175
======================================
Box 4373
--------------------------------------

     I couldn't do it. Fear had made
me still, unable to move.
======================================
Box 4374
--------------------------------------

     It seemed so right, but I
couldn't do it. I was too afraid to
choose between the darkness and the
blade.
======================================
Box 4375
--------------------------------------

     I ended up having them both.
======================================
Box 4376
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     I'm afraid to die and I'm afraid
to live.
======================================
Box 4377
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     I have been struggling with this
demon ever since then{}and in a way,
I suppose I have been winning the
fight, or else I would be dead.
======================================
Box 4378
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     My life has no purpose, no
meaning, the blade could have ended
it all. I don't know why I chose the
darkness over it.
======================================
Box 4379
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Look around you. Is this
darkness?
======================================
Box 4380
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You chose to live.
======================================
Box 4381
--------------------------------------
[\211 Scarf]
     \175
======================================
Box 4382
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What a miserable creature, I feel
kind of sorry for him even though he
tried to kill us.
======================================
Box 4383
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You shouldn't say that, you have
nothing to be sorry about. He chose
his path, you didn't.
======================================
Box 4384
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I think he never understood that,
and that is why he allowed himself to
sink that far into depression.
======================================
Box 4385
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     He valued others more than
himself, and when alone and defeated,
without anyone else to draw support
from, he gave up on life.
======================================
Box 4386
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     He didn't give up completely.
======================================
Box 4387
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Yes, he wasn't a complete fool.
He was smart before all of this.
======================================
Box 4388
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I understand where he is coming
from, though. We have all been there
to some degree.
======================================
Box 4389
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     There is no turning back now. We
have the last piece of the jade sword.
======================================
Box 4390
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's find someone who can
assemble it and put an end to all
of this.
======================================
Box 4391
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I have been thinking what good
the sword of jade will do.
======================================
Box 4392
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Did it not suck the life out of
you when you used its true power?
======================================
Box 4393
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It did.
======================================
Box 4394
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     It's better we have it than
anyone else, we won't allow it to
defeat us.
======================================
Box 4395
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     What about Scarf? Don't you
remember his story?
======================================
Box 4396
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     He was on the verge of death,
he wanted to die, yet he found the
jade sword\175
======================================
Box 4397
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     It was almost like the sword
gave him hope.
======================================
Box 4398
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Either way, the sword is ours,
and we cannot allow anyone else to
have it.
======================================
Box 4399
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I never want to see something
like what happened here again.
======================================
Box 4400
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Let's hurry up and go, I hate
these ruins.
======================================
Box 4401
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     They were a monument as first
suspected, but to defeat and loss.
I do not like this place either, it
reminds me too much of Keltan.
======================================
Box 4402
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     It is somewhat depressing to know
what we know about this. I had always
thought the valorians defeated Grinlow
in Cyport and everything was saved.
======================================
Box 4403
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I don't think the majority of
people would do well to know the
truth.
======================================
Box 4404
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Don't say things like that. They
would do well to know the truth, but
they would not do well to allow it to
make them miserable.
======================================
Box 4405
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     It will remain here to be found
by all of those who want to know.
There is nothing to worry about.
======================================
Box 4406
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Maybe after we defeat Gahn and
save the land, we could come back here
and rebuild it, make it into a
perfect-town!
======================================
Box 4407
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Let's just go.
======================================
Box 4408
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Goodbye, Scarf.
======================================
Box 4409
--------------------------------------
[\215 ????]
     Whaa! Save me!
======================================
Box 4410
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What is that child doing here?
======================================
Box 4411
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     The werewolf must have left her
here for later use, and that must be
his watchdog.
======================================
Box 4412
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You don't mean\175 alright, looks
like we'll have to fix that.
======================================
Box 4413
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Yeah, looks like we will. Too bad
that monster can't understand a word
we say, can you, you big dumb
butterball?
======================================
Box 4414
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     Grrr!
======================================
Box 4415
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     He looks kind of strong, and
angry.
======================================
Box 4416
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     So what! Are you going to run
away?
======================================
Box 4417
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No\175 I'm not.
======================================
Box 4418
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Good, then that leaves us with
only one option. Draw your blade.
======================================
Box 4419
--------------------------------------
[\215 ????]
     Whaaa! I want my mommy!
======================================
Box 4420
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Is your mommy in Fralin?
======================================
Box 4421
--------------------------------------
[\215 ????]
     Yes\175 I want to go home!
======================================
Box 4422
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's take her home.
======================================
Box 4423
--------------------------------------
[\225 ????]
     Oh my stars, is that my baby?
======================================
Box 4424
--------------------------------------
[\215 ????]
     Mommy!
======================================
Box 4425
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We found her in Anon's tomb.
======================================
Box 4426
--------------------------------------
[\225 ????]
     Thank you so very, very much for
saving my angel.
======================================
Box 4427
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You're welcome, it was no
problem.
======================================
Box 4428
--------------------------------------
[\225 ????]
     Feel free to visit us anytime you
like, you are always welcome in our
home.
======================================
Box 4429
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     That was very sweet of you, for
a change.
======================================
Box 4430
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What was?
======================================
Box 4431
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     The wandering Dogero I knew
wouldn't have saved that child, he
wouldn't even have stepped foot into
that stick-hole.
======================================
Box 4432
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     How long have you been following
me?
======================================
Box 4433
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What!
======================================
Box 4434
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh, get over yourself! I haven't
been following you, I just happened
to be in the Forest Pass while you
were scaring those kids.
======================================
Box 4435
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Sure you were.
======================================
Box 4436
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You are so full of it!
======================================
Box 4437
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's go back to the hole.
======================================
Box 4438
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Whatever you say\175
======================================
Box 4439
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     \175my little snot-ero.
======================================
Box 4440
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     \175What?
======================================
Box 4441
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Quit talking, keep walking!
======================================
Box 4442
--------------------------------------
[\223 ????]
     Hey mister, could I have a few
gold bits?
======================================
Box 4443
--------------------------------------
[\223 ????]
     Hey miss, could I have a few gold
bits?
======================================
Box 4444
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Why?
======================================
Box 4445
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Of course not.
======================================
Box 4446
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     For what?
======================================
Box 4447
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     That depends on what you will
spend it on.
======================================
Box 4448
--------------------------------------
[\223 ????]
     I just want a slime icon{}
I collected the anima myself! It'll
only cost 3$ to have it made.
======================================
Box 4449
--------------------------------------
             - Gave 3$ -
======================================
Box 4450
--------------------------------------
[\223 ????]
     Thank you!
======================================
Box 4451
--------------------------------------
[\223 ????]
     Ha-ha-ha, my first icon. This
will be great!
======================================
Box 4452

======================================
Box 4453
--------------------------------------
           \169 Found \148 Muck \169
======================================
Box 4454
--------------------------------------
          \169 Found \149 Jelly \169
======================================
Box 4455
--------------------------------------
           \169 Found \150 Ooze \169
======================================
Box 4456
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It is the child who wanted bits
to buy an icon\175
======================================
Box 4457
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Seems the child couldn't handle
whatever icon he bought.
======================================
Box 4458
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Poor guy\175
======================================
Box 4459
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     What saddens me most is that I
have grown accustomed to seeing this.
======================================
Box 4460
--------------------------------------
[\223 ????]
     Ah, come on! I want an icon so
I can be stronger and go exploring the
Forest Pass.
======================================
Box 4461
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You are too young to travel
there. It is dangerous.
======================================
Box 4462
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     The monsters would eat you alive.
Having an icon won't change that; it
will probably make it easier on the
monsters if anything.
======================================
Box 4463
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     If you want to go exploring and
fight monsters, you should instead
train with a weapon. An icon won't
help you much by itself.
======================================
Box 4464
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Relying on one would do you harm,
child.
======================================
Box 4465
--------------------------------------
[\223 ????]
     You're no fun at all. I shouldn't
have even bothered with an old fogey.
======================================
Box 4466
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You shouldn't have, but you did.
======================================
Box 4467
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     How rude!
======================================
Box 4468
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Hah, that's the first time
someone has called me that.
======================================
Box 4469
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Old fogey?
======================================
Box 4470
--------------------------------------
[\223 ????]
     I'm sorry for what I said to you
before, for wanting some money for an
icon.
======================================
Box 4471
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What happened?
======================================
Box 4472
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Why?
======================================
Box 4473
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What happened?
======================================
Box 4474
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Why?
======================================
Box 4475
--------------------------------------
[\223 ????]
     Well, I didn't need that much
money, and the ferrarist needed extra
help, so I decided to earn it and not
beg for it.
======================================
Box 4476
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I see.
======================================
Box 4477
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     That is good to hear.
======================================
Box 4478
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Excellent.
======================================
Box 4479
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Yes, it is best to earn things.
======================================
Box 4480
--------------------------------------
[\223 ????]
     Besides, I don't want the icon
anymore. With the money I'm making
now, I'm going to train with the
saludist!
======================================
Box 4481
--------------------------------------
[\232 ????]
     I don't understand\175
======================================
Box 4482
--------------------------------------
[\232 ????]
     Huh?
======================================
Box 4483
--------------------------------------
[\232 ????]
     Oh, hello. I was just crying\175
it is nothing, really.
======================================
Box 4484
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What were you crying about?
======================================
Box 4485
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Nothing? It sounded like
something to me.
======================================
Box 4486
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     It is okay, you can tell me.
======================================
Box 4487
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Did someone hurt you?
======================================
Box 4488
--------------------------------------
[\232 ????]
     Mazing made a sword for me, but
someone stole it. He kept calling me
names until I shared it with him.
======================================
Box 4489
--------------------------------------
[\232 ????]
     He never gave it back\175
======================================
Box 4490
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     That was mean of him.
======================================
Box 4491
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     And so you just sat here and
cried about it? That doesn't solve
anything.
======================================
Box 4492
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You should do something about
that, can't let people pick on you and
get their way.
======================================
Box 4493
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     He has no right to force you to
give him what is not his.
======================================
Box 4494
--------------------------------------
[\232 ????]
     Okay, maybe\175 you could help me
get it back?
======================================
Box 4495
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Sorry, I am too busy to help.
======================================
Box 4496
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I don't have time for that. You
should learn to stand up for yourself!
======================================
Box 4497
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I would like to, but I don't have
the time right now.
======================================
Box 4498
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     No, this is none of my concern.
======================================
Box 4499
--------------------------------------
[\232 ????]
     I understand\175 thanks anyway.
======================================
Box 4500
--------------------------------------
[\232 ????]
     Life is so unfair\175
======================================
Box 4501
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Okay. I am sure he will give it
back if asked.
======================================
Box 4502
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Of course we'll help.
======================================
Box 4503
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Sure thing, lead the way.
======================================
Box 4504
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Where is he?
======================================
Box 4505
--------------------------------------
[\232 ????]
     Follow me.
======================================
Box 4506
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     What is this? Little baby go cry
and tell mommy and daddy? Ha-ha-ha.
======================================
Box 4507
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     That sword is not yours. You
should not have stolen it.
======================================
Box 4508
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Give it back to her.
======================================
Box 4509
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh, ha ha{}shutup!
======================================
Box 4510
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You stole her sword, now give it
back and say you're sorry before I
make you cry.
======================================
Box 4511
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You have something that does not
belong to you, give it back to her.
======================================
Box 4512
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Give the sword back to her or be
ready to face someone bigger than you.
======================================
Box 4513
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     Make me!
======================================
Box 4514
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Alright.
======================================
Box 4515
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Gladly.
======================================
Box 4516
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Heh, okay.
======================================
Box 4517
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     As you wish.
======================================
Box 4518
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     I was only kidding!
======================================
Box 4519
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     Here, have it back, I'm sorry for
taking it from you.
======================================
Box 4520
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     I'll never do it again. I didn't
mean to be such a jerk.
======================================
Box 4521
--------------------------------------
[\232 ????]
     You promise?
======================================
Box 4522
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     I promise.
======================================
Box 4523
--------------------------------------
[\232 ????]
     Thanks for showing me it is best
to stand up to people who do wrong.
I'm glad I got my sword back.
======================================
Box 4524
--------------------------------------
[\232 ????]
     I'm going to train and become a
hero someday!
======================================
Box 4525
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     I'm really sorry about stealing
her sword. I was jealous. I don't have
anything nearly as awesome.
======================================
Box 4526
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     I plan to get my act together
and be a hero along with her.
======================================
Box 4527
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     Rejection\175 it is awfully painful.
======================================
Box 4528
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     Was finally exiled from Fralin,
no big surprise there.
======================================
Box 4529
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What did you do?
======================================
Box 4530
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What did you do?
======================================
Box 4531
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What happened?
======================================
Box 4532
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Explain.
======================================
Box 4533
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     Well, apparently they're all sick
of my whining, pathetic idiocy, and
threw me out.
======================================
Box 4534
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     I've become used to this
treatment over the period of my
miserable waste of a life. So it's
nothing, just another skinned knee.
======================================
Box 4535
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     Who needs them anyway? I sure
don't.
======================================
Box 4536
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     I'm not dependent on anyone. I'm
as free as the avis. I go where I
please, do what I please\175
======================================
Box 4537
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     Perhaps that is why no one can
stand me, because I don't need any of
them and it drives them nutty.
======================================
Box 4538
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     If they can't put up with a
little conflict now and then, then
they aren't worth anyone's time. It's
not like I did anything bad either.
======================================
Box 4539
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     Seems people can't handle the
idea of someone having feelings other
than them, and when they're hurt, they
have the right to speak up.
======================================
Box 4540
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     But what do I know, I'm just a
worthless outcast.
======================================
Box 4541
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     May just as well call me no-shot,
because that's what chance I have in
this life.
======================================
Box 4542
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What exactly happened?
======================================
Box 4543
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You're rambling and whining!
What really happened?
======================================
Box 4544
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Why did they exile you?
======================================
Box 4545
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     If I may interrupt, what exactly
brought your exile about?
======================================
Box 4546
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     I brought to their attention that
there was this giant egg in the middle
of town that some guy had brought and
left there.
======================================
Box 4547
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     I told them it looked like a
monster's egg and that we should get
rid of it{}but no, don't listen to me,
what do I know?
======================================
Box 4548
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     They said it looked pretty and to
leave it alone.
======================================
Box 4549
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     That happens when fighting
monsters; most people don't care what
you do, so long as it doesn't affect
them.
======================================
Box 4550
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     In one town I was blamed for what
a monster had caused, because no one
cared enough to notice what it did
until I was doing something about it.
======================================
Box 4551
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You just have to keep moving
forward and ignore them.
======================================
Box 4552
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     That is horrible.
======================================
Box 4553
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Carefree people are horrible;
they allow bad things to happen
because they are free of the care to
notice or to do anything about it.
======================================
Box 4554
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I wouldn't feel bad about being
exiled by them, wouldn't want to
remain in their company very long.
======================================
Box 4555
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     That's sad, but not surprsing
from what I know of the people in the
town I come from.
======================================
Box 4556
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     They're kind of like that, except
instead of exiling you, they would
have kept you around to have something
to mock and gossip about.
======================================
Box 4557
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I'm glad I don't have to be there
everyday. You don't want to go back
to Fralin, do you?
======================================
Box 4558
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Such actions lead to death. It is
not wise to dwell on it and deny life
like they do.
======================================
Box 4559
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     Maybe you're right. Sitting
around and feeling sorry for myself
won't do me any good.
======================================
Box 4560
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     Have to keep moving.
======================================
Box 4561
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     I heard there is some work to be
had in Cyport. I've always wanted to
travel the waters and learn to sail.
======================================
Box 4562
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     I think I'll get up and head that
way.
======================================
Box 4563
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     Was good talking with you, I'll
see you around.
======================================
Box 4564
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     Hey! Do you remember me?
I remember you.
======================================
Box 4565
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We met a long time ago in the
Forest Pass, I believe.
======================================
Box 4566
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     Yeah, I was really depressed back
then. That is, until you showed up.
======================================
Box 4567
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     I never got a chance to properly
thank you, so here, take this.

[\214 Mayor]
     Greetings, traveler. I hope you
enjoy your stay in Fralin.
======================================
Box 4575

[\214 Mayor]
     What to do, what to do\175
======================================
Box 4576
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What's the matter?
======================================
Box 4577
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Talking to yourself?
======================================
Box 4578
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Is there a problem?
======================================
Box 4579
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     What are you talking about?
======================================
Box 4580
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Oh, hello there, I didn't notice
you come in. I'm becoming deaf in my
old age.
======================================
Box 4581
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     There is this dissatisfied sect
of the populace, you see, and they
want lots of things.
======================================
Box 4582
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Most people do not care about
this and I hardly care that much
either, except for their contemptible
behavior.
======================================
Box 4583
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     I do what they want. I give them
money and meet all of their demands{}
yet they still terrorize!
======================================
Box 4584
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     I do not know what to do.
======================================
Box 4585
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     There is only one way to deal
with those who would take advantage of
others by force. You have to stop
being the nice guy and fight them.
======================================
Box 4586
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You stupid fool. You shouldn't
appease them. When you do, you tell
them it is okay for them to continue
murdering people{}
======================================
Box 4587
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You have to fight them!
======================================
Box 4588
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I do not know which of you are
worse: the one who murders or the one
who has the power to stop the murderer
but does not.
======================================
Box 4589
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     I haven't heard talk like that in
a long, long time. You sound like a
protector.
======================================
Box 4590
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Fralin has a protector, but I
hardly see him anymore. I am sure he
is busy with more pressing matters,
like me.
======================================
Box 4591
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Perhaps I could burden you with
resolving this?
======================================
Box 4592
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Tell me where they are.
======================================
Box 4593
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     The burden's on you, unless you
want to resign as mayor. Quit being
a clown and tell me where they are.
======================================
Box 4594
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Seeing as you won't resolve it,
go ahead. Tell me where they are.
======================================
Box 4595
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Justice is not a burden; only
those who deny it cause trouble.
Tell me where they are.
======================================
Box 4596
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     They camp in the Forest Pass
often, mugging whoever is unfortunate
enough to travel it.
======================================
Box 4597
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     If you could make them stop,
I will compensate you for your
trouble.
======================================
Box 4598
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Please, resolve the bandit
problem in the Forest Pass discretely.
I don't want to alarm anyone, not
that they would care.
======================================
Box 4599
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Look what we have here wandering
the Forest Pass. Not a good idea
friend, heh-heh.
======================================
Box 4600
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     They don't look like they have
much gold on them.
======================================
Box 4601
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     He doesn't look like he has much
gold on him.
======================================
Box 4602
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Their weapons might be worth
something.
======================================
Box 4603
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     His weapon might be worth
something.
======================================
Box 4604
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Yeah, but that means they might
fight back.
======================================
Box 4605
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Yeah, but that means he might
fight back.
======================================
Box 4606
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Ha-ha, the mayor's made you soft.
Easiest loot we've ever had{}no fight
whatsoever!
======================================
Box 4607
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Well, what's it going to be? Are
you going to give us your valuables
or will we have to fight you for them?
======================================
Box 4608
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     The mayor has told me about the
situation, and I have come to remedy
it.
======================================
Box 4609
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     The mayor has told me about the
situation, and we have come to remedy
it.
======================================
Box 4610
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     He's already giving us more gold?
Ha-ha, this is too much!
======================================
Box 4611
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Follow us, we'll take you to the
boss. He'll get a kick out of this.
======================================
Box 4612
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     So, the mayor has met our demands
once again.
======================================
Box 4613
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     He sure is a reasonable man,
ha-ha-ha!
======================================
Box 4614
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You are the leader here, correct?
======================================
Box 4615
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Yeah, I'm the boss. What's it to
you?
======================================
Box 4616
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Just making sure.
======================================
Box 4617
--------------------------------------
[\230 ????]
     They're a bunch of apathetic
idiots who wouldn't care if their
house were on fire so long as it made
a pretty shade of red to look at.
======================================
Box 4618
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Things I have given them, things
that they steal and\175 murder to obtain.
======================================
Box 4619
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     Welcome back. How goes our little
problem?
======================================
Box 4620
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     You\175 killed them?
======================================
Box 4621
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     That cannot be all of the gold
they stole\175 though that is the bag I
gave them. No one else would have it.
======================================
Box 4622
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     I suppose that is proof enough
that the deed is done, on some level
at least.
======================================
Box 4623
--------------------------------------
[\214 Mayor]
     You may keep the gold, though by
letting you have it, I am again
rewarding those who murder. Seems I
cannot win either way.
======================================
Box 4624
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     There is a difference between
what I did and what the bandits did.
If you can't see it, then you're
right, you'll never win.
======================================
Box 4625
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     There is a difference between
what we did and what the bandits did.
If you can't see it, then you're
right, you'll never win.

     A sad tale for that weeping
woman. Her mate took his own life
recently. I don't know why he would
so such a thing.
======================================
Box 4630
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     She made an icon with his anima
and had it buried with him. Too bad
she didn't bury her grief and sorrow
with it. She is here everyday, crying.
======================================
Box 4631
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     I swear there is someone out at
night, but whenever I run out to see,
there's nobody around.
======================================
Box 4632
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     Maybe the graveyard is finally
haunted, perhaps one of the dead has
not yet accepted their fate.
======================================
Box 4633
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     Probably just some joker messing
with me, more than likely.
======================================

     I didn't mean to hurt her.

about?

about.

     She should be angry with me for
what I've done. I am angry with
myself.
======================================

     To take my own life to see if

     *Sob* leave me alone\175
======================================
Box 4648
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Dawn, he wanted you to have this.
======================================
Box 4649
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Dawn, stop crying and take this.
======================================
Box 4650
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     He wanted you to have this, Dawn.
======================================
Box 4651
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Take this, Dawn, as commanded by
the King of Fools.
======================================
Box 4652
--------------------------------------
          - Gave \147 K.Fool -
======================================
Box 4653
--------------------------------------
[\232 Dawn]
     What? Who are you?
======================================
Box 4654
--------------------------------------
[\232 Dawn]
     How do you know my name?
======================================
Box 4655
--------------------------------------
[\232 Dawn]
     What is this?
======================================
Box 4656
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     His icon that you had crafted.
======================================
Box 4657
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     His icon.
======================================
Box 4658
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     His icon.
======================================
Box 4659
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     His icon.
======================================
Box 4660
--------------------------------------
[\232 Dawn]
     You dug it up to spite me?
I don't understand\175
======================================
Box 4661
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You never buried it. He's dead,
there's nothing to cry over but his
memory.
======================================
Box 4662
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You buried it to spite yourself.
He is dead, accept that.
======================================
Box 4663
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You never buried it. He's gone
and you are still alive.
======================================
Box 4664
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     There is nothing to cry about
except his memory.
======================================
Box 4665
--------------------------------------
[\232 Dawn]
     Don't say things like that!
======================================
Box 4666
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     He's dead.
======================================
Box 4667
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     That will not change no matter
how much you cry.
======================================
Box 4668
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     There is no reason to weep for
the dead, not while you are living.
======================================
Box 4669
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Why not? It's true. He killed
himself and you are acting like you're
the one who should have died.
======================================
Box 4670
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     He took his own life; there is no
one to blame but him. If you hang
around here crying everyday, then you
have allowed him to kill you too.
======================================
Box 4671
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What am I suppose to say? That
he died a honorable death?
======================================
Box 4672
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     He killed himself. Whatever he
hoped to achieve, he didn't. There is
no gain in death, just like there is
nothing to gain from crying over this.
======================================
Box 4673
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You may act like you fear the
truth, but you confront it each and
every day at his grave.
======================================
Box 4674
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Does it not anger you that he
killed himself? That he found life{}
the only domain where value can be
had{}not worth living?
======================================
Box 4675
--------------------------------------
[\232 Dawn]

======================================
Box 4676
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     Talk to my friends, for they are
the wisest.
======================================
Box 4677
--------------------------------------
[\147 ????]
     I. Make. Friends.
======================================
Box 4678
--------------------------------------
[\147 ????]
     I didn't want to die. I didn't
want to live either.
======================================
Box 4679
--------------------------------------
[\232 ????]
     It is better to suffer wrong than
do it. That's why I'm so popular.
======================================
Box 4680
--------------------------------------
[\232 ????]
     Falling down and bruising myself,
I discovered the meaning of life.
We share the same end.
======================================
Box 4681
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     Heh-heh-heh\175
======================================
Box 4682
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Who are you?
======================================
Box 4683
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Why are you snickering?
======================================
Box 4684
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What are you laughing at?
======================================
Box 4685
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Speak.
======================================
Box 4686
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     Like you, I have known what it is
like to be alone in a town full of
people. Unlike you, I have done
something about it.
======================================
Box 4687
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     People are puppets to be played
with, you see.
======================================
Box 4688
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What have you done?
======================================
Box 4689
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What have you done?
======================================
Box 4690
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What have you done?
======================================
Box 4691
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     What have you done?
======================================
Box 4692
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     I knew you would ask that.
======================================
Box 4693
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     You are unlike everyone else
here. You actually care to know what
is going on behind your back. You are
brave enough to confront the darkness.
======================================
Box 4694
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     I killed them.
======================================
Box 4695
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     I have discovered a way to use
my anima to control the dead.
======================================
Box 4696
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     That look on your face, I can't
quite get enough of it! I will be sure
to keep it on you.
======================================
Box 4697
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Run! Get out of here!
======================================
Box 4698
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     There's a monster, get out of
here!
======================================
Box 4699
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     There's a monster here, go get
help!
======================================
Box 4700
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     If you value your life: run!
======================================
Box 4701
--------------------------------------
[\228 ????]
     Eh?
======================================
Box 4702
--------------------------------------
[\228 ????]
     Look, I don't care what kind of
game you are playing. Leave me out of
it.
======================================
Box 4703
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We're not playing a game, this
is serious{}he has murdered these
people and controls them with his
anima!
======================================
Box 4704
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     This isn't a game, fool! This is
a monster. He's killed these people
and will not hesitate to do the same
to you!
======================================
Box 4705
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I'm not joking! He's killed these
people and controls them with his
anima.
======================================
Box 4706
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Get out of here! There is a great
evil here, who will kill you given
the opportunity.
======================================
Box 4707
--------------------------------------
[\228 ????]
     Whatever.
======================================
Box 4708
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     Hah, whatever. Whatever! What a
beautiful and fitting word for my
zombie.
======================================
Box 4709
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     What are you going to do? No one
cares about what I am doing{}you saw
her reaction to the truth! Therefore
it is okay.
======================================
Box 4710
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     Popular sentiment dictates
morality, does it not? I'm no less
evil than you. It is all a matter of
opinion.
======================================
Box 4711
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I am going to kill you.
======================================
Box 4712
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     Aw, why the sad face? Did I push
a button or pull a string?
======================================
Box 4713
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Her life is not your property to
take and do what you please with!
======================================
Box 4714
--------------------------------------
[\228 ????]
     My life is his property to take
and do what he pleases with.
======================================
Box 4715
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     Ha-ha-ha! Listen to her! The
mouth on this girl!
======================================
Box 4716
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     And what's that suppose to mean?
What is this matter of opinion?
======================================
Box 4717
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     It's{}
======================================
Box 4718
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Oh shutup, I have heard enough
out of you!
======================================
Box 4719
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Then I guess it is okay to kill
you, seeing as no one would care.
======================================
Box 4720
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     Go ahead and try!
======================================
Box 4721
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You are evil not because of
opinion, but because of fact. You
killed her and these poor fools, and
for that, you die.
======================================
Box 4722
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     I knew you'd probably go and say
something like that. Well, let's get
this ugly business behind us. You'll
be much more pleasant afterward.
======================================
Box 4723
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     It must be difficult fighting
for those who could care less\175
======================================
Box 4724
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     Heh-heh\175 why do you save them?
======================================
Box 4725
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     You get no reward\175 you get
nothing!
======================================
Box 4726
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     My reward is knowing you are
dead, and cannot harm me or anyone
I care about.
======================================
Box 4727
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Blah-blah, shutup and die
already. I will be much happier when
you do.
======================================
Box 4728
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Who said I'm doing this for them?
======================================
Box 4729
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You aimed to make us your
puppets. What would we have gained
from that?
======================================
Box 4730
--------------------------------------
[\213 ????]
     Hah, what a stupid way to live\175
to live for yourself\175
======================================
Box 4731
--------------------------------------
[\233 ????]
     Let me be, traveler.
======================================
Box 4732
--------------------------------------
[\233 ????]
     I am too tired to talk.
======================================
Box 4733
--------------------------------------
[\233 ????]
     Go your way; nothing of import
here.
======================================
Box 4734
--------------------------------------
[\233 ????]
     Pay it no attention, it is merely
a relic of my youth.
======================================
Box 4735
--------------------------------------
[\233 ????]
     There is nothing special about
that sword. I have given it up.
======================================
Box 4736
--------------------------------------
[\233 ????]
     I don't want to talk about it.
======================================
Box 4737
--------------------------------------
[\233 ????]
     Fine, I will talk if that is what
it takes for you to leave.
======================================
Box 4738
--------------------------------------
[\233 ????]
     I am not yet senile, but I am no
longer young. I do not know if I have
wasted my years or not.
======================================
Box 4739
--------------------------------------
[\233 ????]
     You see, I have been in deep
contemplation of the events that have
led me to this place, and I don't
know anymore\175
======================================
Box 4740
--------------------------------------
[\233 ????]
     I barely have enough will left
to go on living, and my thoughts
frequently dwell on death. I don't
want to die, at least not like this.
======================================
Box 4741
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What happened?
======================================
Box 4742
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What happened?
======================================
Box 4743
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What happened?
======================================
Box 4744
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     What happened?
======================================
Box 4745
--------------------------------------
[\233 ????]
     I do not want to bore you with
my past, so I will try my best to be
concise.
======================================
Box 4746
--------------------------------------

     When I was younger, my
surroundings led me to nihilistic
beliefs and a hatred of mankind.
A hatred of the nature of reality.
======================================
Box 4747
--------------------------------------

     At some point I solved that
problem and realized who my enemies
really were{}not reality but those
who deny it.
======================================
Box 4748
--------------------------------------

     I began to train myself with that
sword. I also began calling myself a
hero, much to the amusement and
laughter of everyone around me.
======================================
Box 4749
--------------------------------------

     Eventually{}probably due to the
fame from the scandal people viewed me
as, I found a few others like me, who
considered themselves heroes too.
======================================
Box 4750
--------------------------------------

     We decided to save the world.
======================================
Box 4751
--------------------------------------

     Together, we traveled the land
saving things worth saving, mastering
techniques, and sharpening our swords
and skill, until that day\175
======================================
Box 4752
--------------------------------------

     I found myself in another simple
and straightforward quest, or so I
thought.
======================================
Box 4753
--------------------------------------

     That is how these stories always
seem to end, don't they? You never see
it coming until it is too late.
======================================
Box 4754
--------------------------------------

     I traveled and fought my whole
life up to that point for what I
thought was right, having confidence
in and high approval of my actions{}
======================================
Box 4755
--------------------------------------

     But all it took was one moment
to show me it was all fake and
unwarranted.
======================================
Box 4756
--------------------------------------
[\233 ????]
     The name's Charlocke, friend.
I hope you never find yourself in my
situation; there's really no cure for
it.
======================================
Box 4757
--------------------------------------
[\233 Charlocke]
     There is no cure for what I have.
======================================
Box 4758
--------------------------------------
[\233 Charlocke]
     I wonder how much longer I'll
last.
======================================
Box 4759
--------------------------------------
[\233 Charlocke]
     Purposeless chaos. We all follow
the wheel.
======================================
Box 4760
--------------------------------------
[\223 ????]
     I saw you talking with good old
Charlocke. How is he? Doing well?
Ha-ha-ha!
======================================
Box 4761
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Who are you?
======================================
Box 4762
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     And who would you be?
======================================
Box 4763
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Who are you?
======================================
Box 4764
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You were spying on us?
======================================
Box 4765
--------------------------------------
[\223 ????]
     The name's Wobbler. The
pleasure's all mine.
======================================
Box 4766
--------------------------------------
[\223 Wobbler]
     I don't know all of what he told
you, but let me just say this: I'm
not the one who killed that child,
ha-ha!
======================================
Box 4767
--------------------------------------
[\223 Wobbler]
     I hang around here just to see
what he has become{}it is great. He
should have never called himself a
hero.
======================================
Box 4768
--------------------------------------
[\223 Wobbler]
     He was so arrogant and so wrong.
He was putting nasty thoughts into
people's heads, so I had to stop him,
so I had to put him in his place.
======================================
Box 4769
--------------------------------------
[\223 Wobbler]
     Thanks to me, he is nothing now,
and no harm to anyone.
======================================
Box 4770
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You mean no harm to you.
======================================
Box 4771
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Anyone but himself.
======================================
Box 4772
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     That's horrible.
======================================
Box 4773
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You are mad.
======================================
Box 4774
--------------------------------------
[\223 Wobbler]
     Whatever{}what's done is done is
done is done.
======================================
Box 4775
--------------------------------------
[\223 Wobbler]
     Go away, I'm tired of talking to
you.
======================================
Box 4776
--------------------------------------
[\223 Wobbler]
     Poor, poor Charlocke. To think
he was a hero{}ha!
======================================
Box 4777
--------------------------------------
[\223 Wobbler]
     All who think they can achieve
anything in this life will be crushed!
That is the way of the wheel.
======================================
Box 4778
--------------------------------------
[\223 Wobbler]
     The wheel cares not of anything,
it turns and grinds just like it
always has and always will. There is
no escape.
======================================
Box 4779
--------------------------------------
[\233 Charlocke]
     Hey, it is good to see you. Any
reason you've returned to this part
of the woods?
======================================
Box 4780
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Wobbler's still alive.
======================================
Box 4781
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We met Wobbler.
======================================
Box 4782
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Thought you might want to know
Wobbler is nearby.
======================================
Box 4783
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     We met Wobbler.
======================================
Box 4784
--------------------------------------
[\233 Charlocke]
     I see\175
======================================
Box 4785
--------------------------------------
[\233 Charlocke]
     Heh, as easy as that. I realize
what I allowed to happen.
======================================
Box 4786
--------------------------------------
[\233 Charlocke]
     By standing down, I had consented
to the guilt everyone wanted me to
have, a baseless guilt\175
======================================
Box 4787
--------------------------------------
[\233 Charlocke]
     It may have been my sword that
killed the child, but it was an
accident on my part. Wobbler was the
one who pushed him into it.
======================================
Box 4788
--------------------------------------
          \169 Found a \196 Key \169
======================================
Box 4789
--------------------------------------
[\233 Charlocke]
     He took advantage of his
villainy, using a child's death to
stop me. And I let him go. I let him
get away with murder.
======================================
Box 4790
--------------------------------------
[\233 Charlocke]
     I will go change that now.
======================================
Box 4791
--------------------------------------
[\233 Charlocke]
     Perhaps we will meet again?
======================================
Box 4792
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Perhaps.
======================================
Box 4793
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We'll see.
======================================
Box 4794
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I wouldn't be surprised if we
did.
======================================
Box 4795
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Perhaps.
======================================
Box 4796
--------------------------------------
[\233 Charlocke]
     It is time I go do what I should
have done a long time ago. Farewell.
======================================
Box 4797
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     *Sigh* I wonder if I will ever
fall in love. I haven't a care in this
world until I do.
======================================
Box 4798
--------------------------------------
[\232 ????]
     He annoys me sighing about love
and all. He is really quite worthless.
======================================
Box 4799
--------------------------------------
[\232 ????]
     All he does is waste his day
dreaming without doing anything. What
good are dreams without action to make
them real? It is sad.
======================================
Box 4800
--------------------------------------
[\232 ????]
     He used to play the flute very
well. I enjoyed listening.
======================================
Box 4801
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Hey, you wouldn't happen to be
interested in a flute, would you?
I'll sell it for a gold piece.
======================================

     I'll take it.

[\201 Mi'la]
     Here you go.
======================================
Box 4805
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Sounds like a deal to me.
======================================

[\200 Dogero]
     No thank you.

[\201 Mi'la]
     I've no need of it.
======================================
Box 4810
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I'm not interested.
======================================
Box 4811
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I am not interested.
======================================
Box 4812
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     That's too bad. I was hoping to
get rid of it.
======================================
Box 4813
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I bought it from a kid who could
play it well but who didn't care for
it anymore. I never really had the
interest to play like him.
======================================
Box 4814
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Do you want to buy my flute?
One gold piece is all I ask.
======================================
Box 4815
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     *Sigh* I wonder if today will be
the day my true love comes to me\175
I've been waiting forever.
======================================
Box 4816
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Wait! Is that a, no, it can't be\175
======================================
Box 4817
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Is that a flute you have?
======================================
Box 4818
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes.
======================================
Box 4819
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Very perceptive for a carefree
person.
======================================
Box 4820
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yeah.
======================================
Box 4821
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Yes.
======================================
Box 4822
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I used to play one all the time,
I got really good at it too.
======================================
Box 4823
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Hey, you don't mind if I borrow
it, do you?
======================================
Box 4824
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Not at all.
======================================
Box 4825
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You can have it, none of us can
play it.
======================================
Box 4826
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Take it.
======================================
Box 4827
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You may have it.
======================================
Box 4828
--------------------------------------
           - Gave } Flute -
======================================
Box 4829
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Thanks!
======================================
Box 4830
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Maybe with that you will
understand.
======================================
Box 4831
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Understand what?
======================================
Box 4832
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     That love isn't some mysterious
force.
======================================
Box 4833
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     It'll always be a mystery to me.
======================================
Box 4834
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You won't find true love if you
aren't passionate about anything.
You are your work.
======================================
Box 4835
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I don't understand.
======================================
Box 4836
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Love is conditional. If you sigh
your life away without a care in the
world, no one can love you, because
there isn't anything to love.
======================================
Box 4837
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     That's harsh. I like to think
love is the most powerful force in the
land, and that none of us can fully
understand it.
======================================
Box 4838
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Idiot.
======================================
Box 4839
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Use it well; the first step in
finding romantic love is through your
work.
======================================
Box 4840
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     That's an odd idea on what love
is.
======================================
Box 4841
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Is it wrong?
======================================
Box 4842
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I don't know, but I guess I'll
find out.
======================================
Box 4843
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You now have a care in the world.
Play it well.
======================================
Box 4844
--------------------------------------
[\232 ????]
     *Sigh* I love the songs he plays.
======================================
Box 4845
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     You\175 look like a protector, or at
the very least a capable fighter.
======================================
Box 4846
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Why do you ask?
======================================
Box 4847
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Cut to the chase.
======================================
Box 4848
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What's it to you?
======================================
Box 4849
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     That I am, is there a problem?
======================================
Box 4850
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Oh, you see, I, well, underneath
this rock lies a cave{}
======================================
Box 4851
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     And, well, I cannot reach it
anymore, so I put this rock over the
entrance, because there are monsters
in there.
======================================
Box 4852
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     So, perhaps you could either
clear the monsters out or retrieve
some of the water for me? I will
reward you for your troubles.
======================================
Box 4853
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No.
======================================
Box 4854
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Nope.
======================================
Box 4855
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     No way.
======================================
Box 4856
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Not now.
======================================
Box 4857
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Perhaps some other time then\175
======================================
Box 4858
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Could you clear the monsters out
of this cave or retrieve some water
from the lake therein? I will reward
you for your troubles, of course.
======================================
Box 4859
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Alright.
======================================
Box 4860
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     That reward had better be worth
it.
======================================
Box 4861
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yeah, we'll do it.
======================================
Box 4862
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Move the boulder out of the way.
======================================
Box 4863
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Great! I knew you could help me.
======================================
Box 4864
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     In you go.
======================================
Box 4865
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I'll be waiting for you. Try not
to get hurt in there!
======================================
Box 4866
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Strange, the rock is blocking the
exit again.
======================================
Box 4867
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     That fool moved the rock back!
How are we going to get out?
======================================
Box 4868
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's look around. There might be
another exit somewhere.
======================================
Box 4869
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     He moved the rock back. I wonder
why?
======================================
Box 4870
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Probably so any monsters down
here won't sneak past us and reach
him.
======================================
Box 4871
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Seems fishy.
======================================
Box 4872
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yeah.
======================================
Box 4873
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     The boulder is blocking the exit.
======================================
Box 4874
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Let us do what we came here to
do; we can always come back and smash
it if we must.
======================================
Box 4875
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I haven't seen any monsters so
far. He made it seem like there would
be at least some.
======================================
Box 4876
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Must be a large cave.
======================================
Box 4877
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Where are these monsters he was
so afraid of? We haven't seen a single
one yet!
======================================
Box 4878
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     What a coward.
======================================
Box 4879
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Hmm, I haven't seen any monsters
yet. I wonder where they are hiding?
======================================
Box 4880
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Not a single monster so far.
Something is amiss down here.
======================================
Box 4881
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Who is that it?
======================================
Box 4882
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Queit, someone else is here.
======================================
Box 4883
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     He looks like he is in trouble.
======================================
Box 4884
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Someone else is down here.
======================================
Box 4885
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Hey, I could really use a hand!
======================================
Box 4886
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Thank you for your assistance.
I do not know how much longer I could
have lasted without you.
======================================
Box 4887
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     The name's Hacho. Looks like she
tricked you too.
======================================
Box 4888
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What do you mean?
======================================
Box 4889
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I was tricked? Unbelievable.
======================================
Box 4890
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What's going on here?
======================================
Box 4891
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Explain.
======================================
Box 4892
--------------------------------------
[\219 Hacho]
     I have never seen a monster like
her. Her appearance is that of a
woman, but her actions and mind\175
======================================
Box 4893
--------------------------------------
[\219 Hacho]
     It is one of those things you'll
just have to see for yourself.
======================================
Box 4894
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Lead the way.
======================================
Box 4895
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Let's go.
======================================
Box 4896
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Show the way.
======================================
Box 4897
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Take us to her.
======================================
Box 4898
--------------------------------------
[\219 Hacho]
     There is one thing I should
mention first: her power.
======================================
Box 4899
--------------------------------------
[\219 Hacho]
     She can put you in a trance if
you are not careful. Do not look at
her, do not give thought to whatever
she says{}it is meant to kill you.
======================================
Box 4900
--------------------------------------
[\219 Hacho]
     The poor man who let you in fell
for it. He is at her command, and I am
pretty sure the command is to send
people down here for her to play with.
======================================
Box 4901
--------------------------------------
[\219 Hacho]
     We must stop her.
======================================
Box 4902
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Wait, how can we trust you?
======================================
Box 4903
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     If those are her powers, and you
have seen them, then\175
======================================
Box 4904
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Uh, how do we know you aren't
under her spell?
======================================
Box 4905
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Has the monster taken control of
you?
======================================
Box 4906
--------------------------------------
[\219 Hacho]
     An awkward situation, indeed.
======================================
Box 4907
--------------------------------------
[\219 Hacho]
     She had control of me once, but
I broke free a long time ago. Sort of.
======================================
Box 4908
--------------------------------------
[\219 Hacho]
     We share a bond that gives me a
general idea where she is, but also
allows her some control over me in the
form of a strong pull to her location.
======================================
Box 4909
--------------------------------------
[\219 Hacho]
     The only way to end it as far as
I can see is to put an end to her.
======================================
Box 4910
--------------------------------------
[\219 Hacho]
     If you don't trust me, you could
probably leave where you came from by
moving the boulder out of the way.
======================================
Box 4911
--------------------------------------
[\219 Hacho]
     If you do trust me, then come on.
I am tired of this push and pull on my
life.
======================================
Box 4912
--------------------------------------
[\219 Hacho]
     Heh, things are looking up for
me, finally. We might be able to
defeat her together.
======================================
Box 4913
--------------------------------------
[\219 Hacho]
     Come on.
======================================
Box 4914
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Oooooooooo\175
======================================
Box 4915
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Come to me\175
======================================
Box 4916
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Ooo, Hacho, you have come back
for me.
======================================
Box 4917
--------------------------------------
[\219 Hacho]
     Don't give her any of your
attention!
======================================
Box 4918
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     Hacho, you have brought me
friends, how sweet of you. I will
give you a big reward on the lips.
======================================
Box 4919
--------------------------------------
[\219 Hacho]
     Attack!
======================================
Box 4920
--------------------------------------
[? ????]
     How could you hurt me so,
I thought you loved me, my dear
sweet Hacho\175
======================================
Box 4921
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     She's getting away.
======================================
Box 4922
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     She's underwater.
======================================
Box 4923
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Is she drowning?
======================================
Box 4924
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     What a strange creature.
======================================
Box 4925
--------------------------------------
[\219 Hacho]
     I'm going after her. Maybe I have
a chance now.
======================================
Box 4926
--------------------------------------
[\219 Hacho]
     If I don't, it was nice knowing
you.
======================================
Box 4927
--------------------------------------
[\219 Hacho]
     Perhaps our paths will cross
again, farewell!
======================================
Box 4928
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     What do you think you are doing?
======================================
Box 4929
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I said to kill the monsters, or
bring back water!
======================================
Box 4930
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We're leaving.
======================================
Box 4931
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Get out of my way.
======================================
Box 4932
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Make me.
======================================
Box 4933
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Your mind is not your own. Don't
be so weak.
======================================
Box 4934
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Argh!
======================================
Box 4935
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]

======================================
Box 4936
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Alright.
======================================
Box 4937
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Give me all your money and I will
let you live.
======================================
Box 4938
--------------------------------------
[\220 Artikolist]
     Here, just don't hurt me!
======================================
Box 4939
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Smart girl, you are.
======================================
Box 4940
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Get out of my way!
======================================
Box 4941
--------------------------------------
[\220 Artikolist]
     You stopped him!
======================================
Box 4942
--------------------------------------
[\220 Artikolist]
     Thank you so very much. Here,
have a few items on the house.
======================================
Box 4943
--------------------------------------
         \169 Received 4 \227 Max \169
======================================
Box 4944

     It is the least I can do.
Thank you.

Box 4945
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Welcome.
======================================
Box 4946
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It was no problem.
======================================
Box 4947
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Thanks for the items.
======================================
Box 4948
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You're welcome.
======================================
Box 4949
--------------------------------------
[\220 Artikolist]
     Thank you for stopping that
robber. I'm so glad you were there
when you were.
======================================
Box 4950
--------------------------------------
[\220 Artikolist]
     Sorry about the change in prices,
but I was robbed. I have to make back
the money I lost.
======================================
Box 4951
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     We should have never buried it
there, Captain\175
======================================
Box 4952
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     It is too dangerous for me down
there, mate. I buried my treasure in
the wrong place.
======================================
Box 4953
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     You are welcome to my loot, that
is, if you can get past the horrible
snake monster in there.
======================================
Box 4954
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Oh, sorry, I'll get out of your
way.
======================================
Box 4955
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     You are welcome to my treasure.
We be too afraid of the snake
creature. It isn't worth it.
======================================
Box 4956
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I guess we have nothing left to
do but give up and head out.

--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Uh, is something wrong?
======================================
Box 4963
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     It is not wise to stand in my
way.
======================================
Box 4964

[\219 ????]
     Hah, what a bunch of suckers.
Did you really think I would let you
take my treasure?
======================================

--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     To the victor go the spoils!
======================================
Box 4966

[O ????]
     Leave me alone. I am defenseless
and harm no one.
======================================

[O ????]
     Please, I have done nothing to
you. Let me lie in peace.

Box 4987
--------------------------------------
     Fall to your knees!
======================================
Box 4988
--------------------------------------
     That which you let lie dormant
has escaped its shell. I shall cut you
down, laughing! The fear of death
shall consume every living creature{}
======================================
Box 4989
--------------------------------------
     For Dackenmorph has risen, and
you all die.
======================================
Box 4990
--------------------------------------
[\229 ${H10}]
     Are you alright?
======================================
Box 4991
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I'm fine, now at least. What
happened?
======================================
Box 4992
--------------------------------------
[\229 ${H10}]
     You were hurt pretty bad by that
thing. I carried you all back here to
rest.
======================================
Box 4993
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     After facing that\175 it, I think
Gahn might be a breeze. Well, I hope
so{}don't think I can make it through
another fight like that.
======================================
Box 4994
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     It truly was a spawn of Grinlow.
======================================
Box 4995
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     The people of Fralin got what
they deserved.
======================================
Box 4996
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     How can you say that!
======================================
Box 4997
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I don't mean all of them, just
them in general.
======================================
Box 4998
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     The ones who were apathetic and
plagued with boredom\175 none of them
cared about that egg, including us.
We could have prevented this.
======================================
Box 4999
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No regrets, Mi'la.
======================================
Box 5000
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I know. None of us saw it coming.
======================================
Box 5001
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     We defeated it in the end.
======================================
Box 5002
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Yeah, better than nothing.
======================================
Box 5003
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I wouldn't be surprised if Gahn
was behind this.
======================================
Box 5004
--------------------------------------
[\229 ${H10}]
     It was probably his way of
welcoming us back.
======================================
Box 5005
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Maybe.
======================================
Box 5006
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Let's go.
======================================
Box 5007
--------------------------------------
[\225 Mazing]
     I need to get out of this town.
I'll never become a good weapon smith
here.
======================================
Box 5008
--------------------------------------
[\225 Mazing]
     I would move to Cyport, but I
don't have much money saved yet.
======================================
Box 5009
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     How much do you need?
======================================
Box 5010
--------------------------------------
[\225 Mazing]
     I don't want to bother you with
it, I'm not looking for a handout.
======================================
Box 5011
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Then think of it as an
investment.
======================================
Box 5012
--------------------------------------
[\225 Mazing]
     Ha, that sounds okay.
======================================
Box 5013
--------------------------------------
[\225 Mazing]
     I need 30$.
======================================
Box 5014
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I can not afford that at the
moment.
======================================
Box 5015
--------------------------------------
[\225 Mazing]
     Ah well\175 thanks anyway.
======================================
Box 5016
--------------------------------------
[\225 Mazing]
     Are you willing to invest in me
today? All I need is 30$.
======================================
Box 5017
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I would, but I don't have that
much at the moment.
======================================
Box 5018
--------------------------------------
[\225 Mazing]
     Ah well\175 thanks anyway.

     I hereby promise to give you a
good return on your investment if I
am able to make it.

Box 5023
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I believe you will.
======================================
Box 5024
--------------------------------------
[\225 Mazing]
     I sure hope so{}I'm leaving right
now!

--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Why not?
======================================
Box 5031
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     That's none of your business!
======================================

     Hey Dogero, long time no see.
======================================
Box 5034
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I didn't expect to find you here.
It is good to see you, though.
======================================
Box 5035
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     Yeah, well, I decided it was time
for me to settle down a few seasons
ago. You know, after all that has
happened.
======================================
Box 5036
--------------------------------------
[\208 Manx]
     I have adopted a child{}perhaps
you have seen him? He is usually
wearing his yellow hooded jacket
I made for him.
======================================
Box 5037

     I have seen him. He is a good
kid.

     I never got the chance to thank
you for saving me.
======================================

live the life we deserve, and\175

[\200 Dogero]
     I am not ready to settle down

[\200 Dogero]
     Yeah, she's fine.

raising a child, just like she had
always wanted.

[\201 Mi'la]
     I'm glad I didn't have to see
her.

     That wasn't part of the deal.

     Come with me, let's go confront
him.
======================================
Box 5164
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     He's right outside, go take a
look.
======================================
Box 5165
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     If you do not believe me, I can
show him to you.
======================================
Box 5166
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     That's okay, I believe you.
======================================
Box 5167
--------------------------------------
[\209 Innkeeper]
     I won't stop believing in
monsters or ghosts though. This
whole town is haunted!
======================================
Box 5168
--------------------------------------
[\223 ????]
     Hey stranger, there's a lot of
gold and treasure in there. Help
yourself, nobody's home.
======================================
Box 5169
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     That would be stealing.
======================================
Box 5170
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I'm no thief! Well, I am, but
not an immoral one!
======================================
Box 5171
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Wouldn't that be stealing?
======================================
Box 5172
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You are suggesting that I loot
the house?
======================================
Box 5173
--------------------------------------
[\223 ????]
     Heh, call it what you will.
======================================
Box 5174
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It was a trap, figures\175
======================================
Box 5175
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I can not believe I fell for
that, literally.
======================================
Box 5176
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I should have seen that coming\175
======================================
Box 5177
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Hmm. It appears that was a trap.
======================================
Box 5178
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Do I know you? You look
familiar\175
======================================
Box 5179
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Hey, buy me some beer.
======================================
Box 5180
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No.
======================================
Box 5181
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Hey, shut your mouth.
======================================
Box 5182
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You're drunk.
======================================
Box 5183
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I have no reason to.
======================================
Box 5184
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Please! Help an old friend out\175
======================================
Box 5185
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I would, but I don't have any
money.
======================================
Box 5186
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No money, so I couldn't even if
I wanted to.
======================================
Box 5187
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I don't have any money.
======================================
Box 5188
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I do not have any bits.
======================================
Box 5189
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     That's too bad, too bad\175 I was
really looking forward to another
merry round-o-round.
======================================
Box 5190
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Alright.
======================================
Box 5191
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Against my better judgement,
okay.
======================================
Box 5192
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Okay.
======================================
Box 5193
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Okay.
======================================
Box 5194
--------------------------------------
             - Spent 1$ -
======================================
Box 5195
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Thanks! I owe you one.
======================================
Box 5196
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Buddy! *Hic* Hey! Care to buy me
another beer?
======================================
Box 5197
--------------------------------------
[\219 Avis Keeper]
     My birds! All of them{}gone!
======================================
Box 5198
--------------------------------------
[\219 Avis Keeper]
     Curse the earth!
======================================
Box 5199
--------------------------------------
[\219 Avis Keeper]
     I am in no mood to talk while
the clockwork of the universe allows
such misfortune to befall me.
======================================
Box 5200
--------------------------------------
[\218 ????]
     It was a giant monster that stole
them. Would have figured it would have
ate 'em too.
======================================
Box 5201
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     The monster that took them has
quite the reputation around here. Only
one guy I know of that has ever seen
it and lived to tell. His name is Jay.
======================================
Box 5202
--------------------------------------
[\222 ????]
     The keeper should quit his
whining and find some hero to go on
a quest to get them back.
======================================
Box 5203
--------------------------------------
[\224 ????]
     I'm the greatest adventurer in
this whole stinking town. Look all you
want, you won't find any better than
Jay.
======================================
Box 5204
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jay]
     Did Jay ever tell you about the
time he came face to face with the
legendary monster of Adlez? He beat
the trash out of it. 
======================================
Box 5205
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jay]
     What do you want with the great
one?
======================================
Box 5206
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jay]
     You call those swords? Hah, Jay's
seen larger teeth on monsters.
======================================
Box 5207
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Are you the one who has seen the
monster who stole the avis?
======================================
Box 5208
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You must be the clown who has met
the avis-stealing monster.
======================================
Box 5209
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Hey Jay, could you help us out
with the avis problem? I know you are
familiar with the cause of it.
======================================
Box 5210
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You are the man who could help
get the avis back.
======================================
Box 5211
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jay]
     Yes, that Jay is. If you want
them back, Jay has an offer for you.
======================================
Box 5212
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jay]
     Say the four magic words and
throw in a reward, and those avis are
as good as yours.
======================================
Box 5213
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     The four magic words?
======================================
Box 5214
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     The four magic words?
======================================
Box 5215
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I forgot the four magic words.
======================================
Box 5216
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     The four magic words?
======================================
Box 5217
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jay]
     Don't act stupid, everyone knows
the four magic words.
======================================
Box 5218
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jay]
     "Jay is the man."
======================================
Box 5219
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     \175
======================================
Box 5220
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     There is no way I am saying that.
======================================
Box 5221
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Um\175
======================================
Box 5222
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I have no need of your games.
======================================
Box 5223
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jay]
     Say it!
======================================
Box 5224
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Jay is the man.
======================================
Box 5225
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I'm not saying it!
======================================
Box 5226
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Jay is the man.
======================================
Box 5227
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     No.
======================================
Box 5228
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jay]
     Okay, Jay will be back in a day
or two. He'll meet you here and you
can give him his reward.
======================================
Box 5229
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Farewell.
======================================
Box 5230
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Don't get yourself killed.
======================================
Box 5231
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Welcome back. Did you find the
avis?
======================================
Box 5232
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Did Jay find the avis?
======================================
Box 5233
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Looks like you made it back in
one piece. Did you find the avis?
======================================
Box 5234
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You live. Did you find the avis?
======================================
Box 5235
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jay]
     Of course Jay found the avis;
who do you think Jay is, some bird-
brained protector?
======================================
Box 5236
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jay]
     It wasn't easy; when Jay found
the bastard's den, the bastard went
and found Jay. Dark and slimy place,
things got down and dirty.
======================================
Box 5237
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jay]
     Jay had a scuffle, and managed to
send it flying long enough to round up
what was left of the avis and haul
their carcasses back here.
======================================
Box 5238
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jay]
     Do you have Jay's reward? Jay
will be statisfied with no less than
twenty bits.
======================================
Box 5239
--------------------------------------
            - Spent 20$ -
======================================
Box 5240
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jay]
     Nothing like fresh mint for me
to toss at the jabber-head fools of
Adlez.
======================================
Box 5241
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jay]
     See you kids around, Jay has bits
to spend.
======================================
Box 5242
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We don't have that much.
======================================
Box 5243
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Maybe if you told us how much you
wanted before you left we could have
had that much to give you.
======================================
Box 5244
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Um, we don't have that much
presently.
======================================
Box 5245
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     We are low on bits at the moment.
======================================
Box 5246
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jay]
     The way Jay sees it, you need to
turn your dork faces around and go get
my bits. Then maybe Jay will give you
the avis.
======================================
Box 5247
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jay]
     Do you have the twenty bits that
the great one requires?
======================================
Box 5248
--------------------------------------
[\219 Avis Keeper]
     Most excellent! I thank you for
getting my lovely birds back.
======================================
Box 5249
--------------------------------------
[\219 Avis Keeper]
     I will probably kick myself for
doing this later, but I want you to
have one as a reward.
======================================
Box 5250
--------------------------------------
         \169 Acquired \254\255Adlez \169
======================================
Box 5251
--------------------------------------
[\219 Avis Keeper]
     My birds have all returned.
Thank you.
======================================
Box 5252
--------------------------------------
[\219 Avis Keeper]
     Life is glorious.
======================================
Box 5253
--------------------------------------
[\219 Avis Keeper]
     The clockwork of the universe be
damned so long as there are people
like you.
======================================
Box 5254
--------------------------------------
[\218 ????]
     I heard the monster that took the
avis is crippled, thanks to Jay. He
really is the man!
======================================
Box 5255
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I admire people like Jay, though
I don't always like their personality,
especially in Jay's case. They do what
I'm too afraid of doing.
======================================
Box 5256
--------------------------------------
[\222 ????]
     The keeper is a changed man, or
is it he is himself again?
======================================
Box 5257
--------------------------------------
[\220 ????]
     I was na\250ve because I had dreams.
======================================
Box 5258
--------------------------------------
[\220 ????]
     I was na\250ve because I knew that
there was no way someone would tell me
something that was a total fabrication
just to laugh at me behind my back.
======================================
Box 5259
--------------------------------------
[\220 ????]
     I was na\250ve because\175 you look
like you don't agree.
======================================
Box 5260
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I don't.
======================================
Box 5261
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It is not wrong to have dreams,
or to believe others are capable of
telling you the truth. Don't let it
get you down.
======================================
Box 5262
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Don't give up on your dreams,
or you will give up on yourself.
Believe me, I know.
======================================
Box 5263
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Only people who do not have any
strong desires, or have failed in
achieving them, make fun of people
like you.
======================================
Box 5264
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Don't give up on your dreams,
or you will have given up on yourself.
======================================
Box 5265
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What's wrong with being na\250ve
like that? That's the good na\250ve!
======================================
Box 5266
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I'm na\250ve if it means I want to
accomplish great things, or if it
means I believe in great things.
======================================
Box 5267
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     They are the ones who are na\250ve,
to think they can stop you.
======================================
Box 5268
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Don't let people like them stand
between you and your highest desires.
Knock them off your path or jump over
them, whatever it takes to overcome.
======================================
Box 5269
--------------------------------------
[\220 ????]
     I\175 don't know what to say.
======================================
Box 5270
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Don't worry, I know the feeling.
It is a good one, though a bit
awkward.
======================================
Box 5271
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Then don't say anything, let your
actions speak for you.
======================================
Box 5272
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     That's probably what caused this;
you can't let people with tears in
their hearts get away with calling you
things you aren't.
======================================
Box 5273
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You don't have to say anything,
the feeling is mutual.
======================================
Box 5274
--------------------------------------
[\220 ????]
     Heh, you're right. It is somewhat
funny that I didn't understand sooner.
======================================
Box 5275
--------------------------------------
[\220 ????]
     I'll never give up on my dreams.
======================================
Box 5276
--------------------------------------
[\220 ????]
     I'll never give up on my dreams.
Maybe when next you find me, I can
show you that I made good on them.
======================================
Box 5277
--------------------------------------
[\238 ????]
     Say, you didn't come through the
Forest Pass by chance, did you?
======================================
Box 5278
--------------------------------------
[\238 ????]
     The reason I ask is, well, it is
a long story. I won't bother you with
it all. Hah, I tell it too much as is.
======================================
Box 5279
--------------------------------------
[\238 ????]
     There is this creature I have
been hunting my entire life that lives
there. I could never catch it, no
matter how hard I tried.
======================================
Box 5280
--------------------------------------
[\238 ????]
     In fact, I don't believe it can
be caught. If I can't do it, nobody
can!
======================================
Box 5281
--------------------------------------
[\238 ????]
     Its name is Kresse. Large green
thing, with an odd colored mane,
stands on all fours\175
======================================
Box 5282
--------------------------------------
[\238 ????]
     Have you seen Kresse? I know that
thing is in the Forest Pass somewhere,
and since I can't get it, no one will.
======================================
Box 5283
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It isn't there anymore. I met it.
======================================
Box 5284
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Just because you have failed,
doesn't meant everyone will. We killed
it.
======================================
Box 5285
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You're right about one thing,
you'll never get it because we killed
it.
======================================
Box 5286
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     No, since we killed it, you never
will.
======================================
Box 5287
--------------------------------------
[\238 ????]
     You what!
======================================
Box 5288
--------------------------------------
[\238 ????]
     Impossible!
======================================
Box 5289
--------------------------------------
[\238 ????]
     There's no way!
======================================
Box 5290
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You can have what's left of it.
======================================
Box 5291
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We saved a piece for you.
======================================
Box 5292
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Don't believe me? Take a look at
this.
======================================
Box 5293
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You may look upon this and know
your impossible was possible.
======================================
Box 5294
--------------------------------------
          - Gave \213 Kresse -
======================================
Box 5295
--------------------------------------
[\238 ????]
     There's no way\175
======================================
Box 5296
--------------------------------------
[\238 ????]
     Kresse, after all these years
you're finally mine. I guess it wasn't
impossible after all.
======================================
Box 5297
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     Hello there, spare a moment? I am
curious as to your thoughts on effort
as it relates to personal gain.
======================================
Box 5298
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Why?
======================================
Box 5299
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     Sheesh, I said I was simply
curious. You're like talking to a
brick wall. Bend a little!
======================================
Box 5300
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     No thanks, I don't have any
moments to spare.
======================================
Box 5301
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I can already tell you are a fool
and that I would gain nothing from
talking to you.
======================================
Box 5302
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     That's pretty harsh, and evasive!
You don't want to confront me because
you have nothing to say.
======================================
Box 5303
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Ahem.
======================================
Box 5304
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Invest thought and effort into
something and you are rewarded with
gain; the more of yourself that you
invest, the more you will gain.
======================================
Box 5305
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     I disagree. Defend that.
======================================
Box 5306
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You stupid idiot. I cannot defend
something that was never attacked!
======================================
Box 5307
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     All effort is futile, and
therefore foolish.
======================================
Box 5308
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     We should pursue immediate
pleasure, to bring immediate joy; our
mindset should be completely unlike
the insanity of my mother's{}
======================================
Box 5309
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Leave it to someone with a broken
mind to have such broken ideas.
======================================
Box 5310
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     Only fate decides our success
or failure, effort is meaningless!
======================================
Box 5311
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Then why do anything? Why are you
talking to me? You are using a lot of
effort for something fate will take
care of regardless of your action.
======================================
Box 5312
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     Argh, I want to hate you but
can't due to your insufferable logic.
======================================
Box 5313
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Have you ever accomplished
something you had set out to do?
It brings a much better feeling than
this \185immediate pleasure' business.
======================================
Box 5314
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     In fact, you would probably feel
great if you were able to convince me
of your idiocy. That's your aim,
right?
======================================
Box 5315
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     Gahn, I don't need this.
======================================
Box 5316
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You know, working toward my goals
is how I get immediate pleasure too.
It is what brings me joy, and I'm
the happiest when I achieve one.
======================================
Box 5317
--------------------------------------
[\231 ????]
     Argh! I cannot take this
punishment!
======================================
Box 5318
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Hah, fool.
======================================
Box 5319
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     This story stinks.
======================================
Box 5320
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Boo. Hiss.
======================================
Box 5321
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I feel sorry for the frog; he was
kicked on and in the end, he is just
supposed to say he is sorry and move
on? It makes me sad.
======================================
Box 5322
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     This story reminds me of what my
parents told me about the \185hard knocks
of life'. I don't want to grow up.
======================================
Box 5323
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     These stories about Gahn calling
down on people scare me. I hope he
will never call down on me for
anything.
======================================
Box 5324
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Hey miss, tell us a story!
======================================
Box 5325
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Perhaps Dogero can, I don't have
time for babies.
======================================
Box 5326
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Hey Johan, do you have any new
stories you could tell us?
======================================
Box 5327
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Sorry, I don't, but I'm sure
Dogero has a lot of interesting ones
to tell.
======================================
Box 5328

[\219 ????]
     You're scary looking!

Box 5330
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Hey mister, tell us a story!
======================================
Box 5331
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Yeah, the teacher's stories are
horrible.
======================================
Box 5332
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     And scary.
======================================
Box 5333
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Tell us a good story, please?
======================================
Box 5334
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No.
======================================
Box 5335
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Aw, come on!
======================================
Box 5336
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Alright.
======================================
Box 5337
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Yay!
======================================
Box 5338
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Once upon a time, there was a
swordsman atop a mountain covered in
clouds\175
======================================
Box 5339
--------------------------------------

     It was there he came face to face
with the man who calls down upon
people, a man unlike any you have seen
before{}
======================================
Box 5340
--------------------------------------

     A man who people call Gahn.
======================================
Box 5341
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Why was he up there?
======================================
Box 5342
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     He had his reasons.
======================================
Box 5343
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     What were his reasons?
======================================
Box 5344
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Was he a protector?
======================================
Box 5345
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     What happened after that?
======================================
Box 5346
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Listen and I will tell you.
======================================
Box 5347
--------------------------------------

     Gahn had brought out the worst
fears of the swordsman. All of his
allies were lying in defeat around
him. He didn't understand why.
======================================
Box 5348
--------------------------------------

     Gahn told him why, saying that
defeat is the natural order of life,
that when one acts on one's own
behalf, one is destined to fail.
======================================
Box 5349
--------------------------------------

     He then called out to the
swordsman to attack him using his
best attack, an attack the swordsman
knew about but had never used before.
======================================
Box 5350
--------------------------------------

     It knocked the wind out of him,
sending him to his knees.
======================================
Box 5351
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     He was okay, right?
======================================
Box 5352
--------------------------------------
======================================
Box 5353
--------------------------------------

     He then fell completely to the
ground, dead.
======================================
Box 5354
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     And that's how the story ends.
======================================
Box 5355
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     \175
======================================
Box 5356
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I was hoping the swordsman would
get up.
======================================
Box 5357
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Your story is just like our
teacher's ones.
======================================
Box 5358
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     What's the point of me doing
anything if I'll fail in the end?
It's not fair.
======================================
Box 5359
--------------------------------------

     Ignoring his intense pain, he got
up and walked himself all the way down
the mountain, collapsing when he
reached the bottom.
======================================
Box 5360
--------------------------------------

     When he woke up, he traveled the
land in defeat, looking for something
he knew he would never find.
======================================
Box 5361
--------------------------------------

     One day he was walking through
the woods and a pack of wolves spotted
him. They followed, being one step
ahead and one step behind.
======================================
Box 5362
--------------------------------------

     At one point, they gathered in
front of the swordsman, blocking his
path. One brave wolf flashed its fangs
and ran at him.
======================================
Box 5363
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     And he killed it and sent the
wolves running!
======================================
Box 5364
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Yeah, that would be great.
======================================
Box 5365
--------------------------------------
======================================
Box 5366
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     He didn't; he let the wolf bite
him.
======================================
Box 5367
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Why?
======================================
Box 5368
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     He considered himself dead. His
life ended when he was defeated atop
the mountain.
======================================
Box 5369
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I was hoping the swordsman would
fight.
======================================
Box 5370
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     He did; he sliced it in two.
======================================
Box 5371
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Sweet!
======================================
Box 5372
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     What happened next?
======================================
Box 5373
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Well, I guess he finds his way
back to Gahn one day and confronts
him.
======================================
Box 5374
--------------------------------------

     Gahn's not happy that the
swordsman didn't learn his lesson.
He calls down to him and says,
======================================
Box 5375
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     And what did the swordsman do?
======================================
Box 5376
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     He drew his sword and attacked
Gahn.
======================================
Box 5377
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     No way!
======================================
Box 5378
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     What happened? What happened?
======================================
Box 5379
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Did Gahn kill him?
======================================
Box 5380
--------------------------------------
======================================
Box 5381
--------------------------------------

     Gahn struck him down a second
time, and the swordsman never got up.
======================================
Box 5382
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     And that's how the story ends.
======================================
Box 5383
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I was hoping the swordsman would
prove Gahn wrong.
======================================
Box 5384
--------------------------------------

     There was a great struggle,
neither one held back anything.
======================================
Box 5385
--------------------------------------

     They fought so hard that the
mountain itself trembled in fear,
sending everyone below to their
knees.
======================================
Box 5386
--------------------------------------

     In the end, the swordsman was
exhausted and his pain screamed at him
to give up.
======================================
Box 5387
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     That time something different
happened.
======================================
Box 5388
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Something the universe had not
planned.
======================================
Box 5389
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Gahn found himself on his knees,
looking up at the silhouette of the
swordsman, blinded by the light from
the sun behind him.
======================================
Box 5390
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     The swordsman looked down at him
and said something that, before this
moment, he would have never thought he
had the courage to say.
======================================
Box 5391
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     He said, "Defeat is the nature
of your existence, not mine."
======================================
Box 5392
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Wow\175
======================================
Box 5393
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     That's the greatest story I have
ever heard!
======================================
Box 5394
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Yeah!
======================================
Box 5395
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Tell us another one!
======================================
Box 5396
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Perhaps some other time. I have
to go{}hope you all succeed at
whatever you set out to do.
======================================
Box 5397
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I want to be a swordsman when I
grow up.
======================================
Box 5398
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I hope I will have enough courage
to stand up for myself like the
swordsman did.
======================================
Box 5399
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I'm not listening to another one
of our teacher's stories ever again.
Yours is too good!
======================================
Box 5400
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I think the point of the story
is that someone doesn't fail until
they give up.
======================================
Box 5401
--------------------------------------
[\219 Teacher]
     I don't understand; right when it
came time for the day's story, my
students told me my tales do not apply
to them and left.
======================================
Box 5402
--------------------------------------
[\219 Teacher]
     How could this happen? They have
become too selfish.
======================================
Box 5403
--------------------------------------
[\221 ????]
     I've given up working. It is
pointless and a waste of time. You
should try taking it easy like me.
======================================
Box 5404
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No.
======================================
Box 5405
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Idiot.
======================================
Box 5406
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You're an idiot.
======================================
Box 5407
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     I am not a sub-being like you.
======================================
Box 5408
--------------------------------------
[\221 ????]
     Do you know how easy it is to
make fun of and mock you blind goats?
You're the funniest thing since
soberness.
======================================
Box 5409
--------------------------------------
[\221 ????]
     Perfection is unattainable,
nothing anyone does can be better than
my imagination.
======================================
Box 5410
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Don't say something is
unattainable because you have
yet to obtain it.
======================================
Box 5411
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No surprise there, you're
anything but perfect. I'd rather live
in a wish-wash world of imagination
than live as you too.
======================================
Box 5412
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Perfection is attainable if you
actually work to obtain it.
======================================
Box 5413
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You have embraced your own self-
designed flaws. Enjoy your demise.
======================================
Box 5414
--------------------------------------
[\221 ????]
     Whatever. While you're killing
yourselves for nothing, I'll be
kicking back and relaxing{}hah!
======================================
Box 5415
--------------------------------------
[\221 ????]
     Ugh, look at you people. You make
me sick.
======================================
Box 5416
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What do you imagine?
======================================
Box 5417
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Well, tell me of your wonderful
imagination.
======================================
Box 5418
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     What do you imagine?
======================================
Box 5419
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     And what is it you imagine?
======================================
Box 5420
--------------------------------------
[\221 ????]
     There's this great work of art,
better than all the pieces of garbage
I have seen combined. No one can make
anything better.
======================================
Box 5421
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     How can something that only
exists in your mind be better than
something that actually exists?
======================================
Box 5422
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It isn't better until you make it
exist. Right now it is nothing more
than wishful thinking.
======================================
Box 5423
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Too late! I just made something
better with my own imagination. Don't
you see how silly you're being?
======================================
Box 5424
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Why don't you make it real? It is
just imaginary now, by your own words.
======================================
Box 5425
--------------------------------------
[\221 ????]
     You don't understand. If I make
it real, I'll be the only one who will
understand it.
======================================
Box 5426
--------------------------------------
[\221 ????]
     Besides, it is just as good in my
mind as it would be if it were real.
There's no reason to make it.
======================================
Box 5427
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     And you are fine with that? You
are more happy sitting here wasting
away than making your dreams real?
======================================
Box 5428
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You fool! Your dreams mean
nothing if you don't fight to make
them real!
======================================
Box 5429
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     There is a reason to make it. If
it is so great, then wouldn't you
enjoy it more if it were real and you
were the one who made it real?
======================================
Box 5430
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Imagination is powerful, like all
aspects of the mind, but its purpose
is to lead to action, not your
inaction.
======================================
Box 5431
--------------------------------------
[\221 ????]
     I guess so, I don't know.
======================================
Box 5432
--------------------------------------
[\221 ????]
     Well, I am not exactly happy-
happy about this.
======================================
Box 5433

[\221 ????]
     Maybe you have a point\175 wow, am
I actually agreeing with you?
======================================
Box 5434
--------------------------------------
[\221 ????]
     I think I'll quit joking around
and make my dream real.
======================================
Box 5435
--------------------------------------
[\221 ????]
     Wow, it's you guys.
======================================
Box 5436
--------------------------------------
[\221 ????]
     I haven't seen you since I left
Adlez. Took what you said to heart and
decided to make my dreams real. 
======================================
Box 5437
--------------------------------------
[\221 ????]
     I know I don't have to do this,
but I want to show my thanks. Take
this icon I crafted. It is the best
icon I have ever dreamed up.

     The end is near! All are doomed!
======================================
Box 5441
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     Ignorance is the root of all
evil, and no one knows the truth!
======================================
Box 5442

[\200 Dogero]
     That would mean everyone is
evil, including you.
======================================
Box 5443
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Why should anyone listen to a
fool who believes no one knows the
truth?
======================================
Box 5444
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Just because you don't know the
truth, that doesn't mean everyone
else doesn't!
======================================
Box 5445
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     That is an interesting claim{}
for it to be true, it would have to
be false.
======================================
Box 5446
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     Behold! There are those among us
who actually believe in such an out-
dated concept as the truth!
======================================
Box 5447
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     I have spent my days wandering
this land, and over the course of my
travels I have learned many things,
many things indeed.
======================================
Box 5448
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     The world is gray, our lives are
a gray mesh of needs and perceptions,
our fate the same yet unknown to us
all.
======================================
Box 5449
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     Death comes for us all, it is
blind, greeting us as equals. Why
should we not be the same as it?
======================================

     In life we are equals, in death
we are equals{}no matter which state
we are in, we are one.
======================================
Box 5451
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     If there is one maximum I have
learned during my wanderings, it is
that by accepting our ignorance, we
find the one way to true insight.
======================================
Box 5452
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     Look to those humble souls you
admire, who know that wisdom comes
from an empty mind with no prejudices,
no certainty, no selfhood.
======================================
Box 5453
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     It is all a matter of perception.
======================================
Box 5454
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     When next something happens to
you, see yourself as part of the
greater whole of existence. All will
make sense and you will be at peace.
======================================

     I hope we have all learned
something today. I have enjoyed my
stay with you, but I must move on.
Farewell.

     Oh shutup and answer my question.
======================================
Box 5458
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I have a question for you.
======================================
Box 5459
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     A question, if I may be so bold.
======================================
Box 5460
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     Speak and be heard.
======================================
Box 5461
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Do you believe all perception is
equally valid?
======================================
Box 5462
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Is all perception equally valid?
======================================
Box 5463
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     All perception is equally valid,
right?
======================================
Box 5464
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     To you all perception is equally
valid, correct?
======================================

     I see nothing that can go against
that.

     Since you are a wandering
wiseman, do you know more than me?

[\201 Mi'la]
     How about you, are you wiser than
anyone here?
======================================
Box 5468
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You seem to be a wandering
wiseman, doesn't that make you wiser
than the rest of us?
======================================
Box 5469
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Are you a wiseman?
======================================
Box 5470

     Having traveled so far and wide,
I have seen things many can only
imagine of, for instance, not too
long ago{}
======================================
Box 5471

[\200 Dogero]
     I will take that as a yes. So,
why should any of us listen to you?
======================================
Box 5472
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I'll take that as a yes, you
wish-wash fool. You have just shown
us all who you really are.
======================================
Box 5473

[\202 Johan]
     Okay, okay, all you have to say
is yes. Thanks for showing us who you
really are.
======================================

[\203 Pyrus]
     All you need say is yes. Good,
now you might begin to be honest.

     I do not follow.
======================================
Box 5476

     You are a liar.

     You are a liar.

[\203 Pyrus]
     You are a liar.

[\226 ????]
     You have no right to accuse me
of such!
======================================
Box 5481
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You believe we are all the same,
yet you also want to come across as
wiser than us. You cannot have it both
ways.
======================================
Box 5482
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     And you have no right to dismiss
truth because you don't like the idea
of it, being a liar and all.
======================================
Box 5483
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     We're all doomed! Truth doesn't
exist! To know nothing is to know
everything! I'm a crazy idiot!
======================================
Box 5484
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Truth exists; you cannot close
your eyes and cover your ears and
wish it away.
======================================
Box 5485
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     It is all a matter of perception,
and we are all equal in the eyes of
the universe.

     Liar.

[\202 Johan]
     When did the universe get eyes?
You sure are full of nonsense.
======================================

insult!
======================================

     Your kind is neither wanted nor
needed.
======================================

     My kind?
======================================

======================================

than good here.

     Do not engage me, scum.
======================================
Box 5497
--------------------------------------

     Leave me alone.
======================================
Box 5498
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     I said leave me alone!
======================================
Box 5499
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Then leave us alone.
======================================
Box 5500
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Then stop bothering us.
======================================
Box 5501
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Alright, if you leave us alone.
======================================
Box 5502
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     It is my duty to inform the
people that you do not belong. I am
not going anywhere.
======================================

[\200 Dogero]
     Alright.
======================================
Box 5504
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We'll see about that.
======================================

     If that's how you want to play
it, so be it.
======================================
Box 5506

[\226 ????]
     You're insane!
======================================
Box 5507
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Now he has a reason to hate us.
======================================
Box 5508
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I'll be surprised if we ever see
him again.
======================================
Box 5509

     I don't think he'll be bothering
us anymore.
======================================

I've no place to send my ore. Wish
somebody could get rid of those
raiders.
======================================
Box 5511
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I have my own ore mine, but no
reason to use it. If I had someone to
ship it to, I would.
======================================
Box 5512
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Perhaps you could find me someone
who wants some?
======================================
Box 5513

ore?
======================================

can't.

[\203 Pyrus]
     Why can't you?
======================================
Box 5523
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     There is a whole mess of monsters
in my mine. If you could clear them
out, I'd give you some ore free of
charge. How about it?
======================================

[\200 Dogero]
     I've heard enough.
======================================

[\201 Mi'la]
     Stop. I have heard enough.
======================================

[\202 Johan]
     I can't take anymore!

for the sake of talking is a waste.

[\225 Fortuneteller]
     Come hither, my child, so that
I may tell you your fortune.
======================================
Box 5567
--------------------------------------
[\225 Fortuneteller]
     All I ask in return is one
paltry bit.
======================================
Box 5568
--------------------------------------
             - Spent 1$ -
======================================
Box 5569
--------------------------------------
[\225 Fortuneteller]
     Close your eyes and concentrate
with me\175
======================================
Box 5570
--------------------------------------

     Once you realize that you are
facing a challenge, you'll rise to
the task.
======================================
Box 5571
--------------------------------------

     Possibility is glorious, but
what's possible isn't necessarily
easy.
======================================
Box 5572
--------------------------------------

     Maybe your reputation precedes
you; maybe people are giving you
funny looks because they don't know
what to think.
======================================
Box 5573
--------------------------------------

     All you know is that you're here
to do a job, and if you have to play
the oddball or the outsider, that's
just how it is.
======================================
Box 5574
--------------------------------------

     I see you hold a vast resentment
to your fellow man.
======================================
Box 5575
--------------------------------------

     Minds will always change. Try
not to bear any grudges for past
miscomforts.
======================================
Box 5576
--------------------------------------

     Understanding would be ideal,
but in the abscene of that light over
your head, you'll settle for
tolerance.
======================================
Box 5577
--------------------------------------

     There are many reasons for
grasping your desires, but if you
fall into selfish patterns, that
behavior can only result in loss.
======================================
Box 5578
--------------------------------------

     It's not about black and white
borders. Certainty limits your
perspective and limits your options.
======================================
Box 5579
--------------------------------------

     Maybe this is okay if it comes
down to a simple decision of right
versus wrong. Stop before you make
yourself crazy.
======================================
Box 5580
--------------------------------------

     Seizing the moment feels good
right now, but in the long run you
could be generating more problems
than you solve.
======================================
Box 5581
--------------------------------------

     Open your angles wider instead
of painting yourself into another
corner.
======================================
Box 5582
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     That's it?
======================================
Box 5583
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     That was stupid.
======================================
Box 5584
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Is it too late to get my bit
back?
======================================
Box 5585
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You have told me nothing useful.
======================================

     Please traveler, find my mate.
======================================

     I last saw him in Keltan. Maybe
he got lost in the desert? I miss him
more than anything.
======================================
Box 5589
--------------------------------------
[\240 ????]
     Have you found him yet?
======================================
Box 5590
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Nope.
======================================
Box 5591
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Not yet.
======================================
Box 5592

[\202 Johan]
     We're still on it.
======================================

     We have not.
======================================

--------------------------------------
[\240 ????]
     Please tell me you have found my
mate\175
======================================

     Nope.
======================================
Box 5597
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     We're still on it.
======================================
Box 5598
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     We have not.
======================================
Box 5599
--------------------------------------
[\240 ????]
     You have found him? Please, I
don't know what I'll do without him\175
======================================
Box 5600
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You would be doing what you are
doing now, minus the worrying.
======================================
Box 5601
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You'll do whatever you have been
doing.
======================================
Box 5602
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You'll probably be doing the same
thing you've been doing, besides
worrying.
======================================
Box 5603
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You'll do what you have been
doing, without worrying.
======================================
Box 5604
--------------------------------------
[\240 ????]
     I guess you're right\175
======================================
Box 5605
--------------------------------------
[\240 ????]
     I'll miss him, but I shouldn't
worry about things beyond my control,
only about that which I do have
control over.
======================================
Box 5606
--------------------------------------
[\240 ????]
     I've known in the back of my mind
that he was being serious when he said
he wanted to stay in Keltan. I just
didn't want to accept it.
======================================
Box 5607
--------------------------------------
[\240 ????]
     He's probably still there now.
Alive? I don't know\175
======================================
Box 5608
--------------------------------------
[\240 ????]
     It is up to me to make the most
of my time; I can't allow things
beyond my control to get in the way.
======================================
Box 5609
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I'm the greatest singer in all
the land. Want to hear me sing?
======================================
Box 5610
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     No.
======================================
Box 5611

[\201 Mi'la]
     No.

     No.

--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Maybe some other time?
======================================
Box 5615
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Okay.
======================================
Box 5616
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Okay.
======================================
Box 5617
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Okay.
======================================
Box 5618
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Okay.
======================================
Box 5619
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Great! I call this one ode to the
desert.
======================================
Box 5620
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     How was it? Did you like it?
======================================
Box 5621
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     It was\175 good.
======================================
Box 5622
--------------------------------------

     You might even come to appreciate
the initial shock to your system for
waking you up.
======================================
Box 5623
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It's not bad.
======================================
Box 5624
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     It was good.
======================================
Box 5625
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Your singing is the same its
always been.
======================================
Box 5626
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Great, I am still the best.
======================================
Box 5627
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I'm going to cheer everyone up
with my beautiful voice.
======================================
Box 5628
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You need to practice more. You
sound like no one has ever been honest
with you about your voice.
======================================
Box 5629
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     That was horrible. You aren't the
best yet, though you do have lots of
potential.
======================================
Box 5630
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Well, let's just say I've heard
worse. If you are serious about
becoming the best, I suggest practice,
lots and lots of practice.
======================================
Box 5631
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You haven't changed since last
I heard you. People can't bear hearing
you, or bear telling you the truth.
======================================
Box 5632
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I see\175
======================================
Box 5633
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Thanks for being honest.
I'll try harder!
======================================
Box 5634
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Try smarter.
======================================
Box 5635
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Don't try, trying is failure!
Do it better.
======================================
Box 5636
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I'd try softer if I were you;
my ears are still ringing.
======================================
Box 5637
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You have a good voice. I don't
think it will be too hard for you.
======================================
Box 5638
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Heh-heh, okay.
======================================
Box 5639

     I'm practicing to be the best
singer in all the land.

     Hi there, you look like you have
some icons on you.
======================================
Box 5641
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I am an icon collector, and am
missing a few ones to complete a few
sets. If you have any, I will pay you
many times what they are worth.
======================================

[\219 ????]
     Now then, can I see if you have
what I need?
======================================

--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Perhaps some other time? I must
have those missing icons.
======================================
Box 5644
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I know you have at least some
icons, can I see if you have any that
I am missing? I will pay you many
times what they are worth.

     If you change your mind, you can
find me here. You'll not find a better
price for your icons anywhere else.

[\219 ????]
     Yes! My collection is now
complete.
======================================
Box 5658
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     It was a pleasure, friend.
======================================

     You may find this funny, but I,
the great icon collector in all the
land, have never used one before.
And I never plan to, either.

     Thank you for saving me from the

     Things beyond my control.

--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I lost my most precious green
icon.
======================================
Box 5681
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     It must've fell out of my pocket
when I was fighting raiders. I should
not have tried to cross the desert
knowing they were out.
======================================
Box 5682
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I'll never get my green icon
back. I lost it in the desert\175 it
would be like trying to find a needle
in a haystack{}impossible!
======================================
Box 5683
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We found an icon in the desert,
is it yours?
======================================

     Might this icon we found in the
desert be yours?
======================================

I think it might be yours.

very dear to me. Thanks for getting
it back.
======================================

     Hah, to think it was impossible.
I'll just have to expect the
impossible with you guys around.

     Trade has ceased between Keltan
and Adlez. If it were to pick back up,
I would continue to do what I do best:
refine ore.
======================================
Box 5696
--------------------------------------
[\220 ????]
     I see you have some ore, very
fine ore indeed.
======================================
Box 5697
--------------------------------------
[\220 ????]
     I can refine it for you. My
refining skills are second to none.
======================================
Box 5698
--------------------------------------
[\220 ????]
     Fifty bits, take it or leave it.
======================================
Box 5699

     It's alright. Take care of that
ore, it will be a pleasure for who-
ever you do choose to refine it.
======================================
Box 5700

     Alright, give me a day and I'll
have your ore ready. I'll see you back
here when I'm finished.
======================================
Box 5701
--------------------------------------
[\220 ????]
     You must have paid a fortune for
it, it is the best ore I have ever
worked with. It will make a fine
blade, if that's what you're after.

raider threat is gone. I heard you
folk were to thank for that. I'm glad
to get back to work.

[\219 ????]
     I'm looking for something new to
add to my painting collection.
======================================
Box 5706
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I have works from all who will
sell them to me from Keel's visual
art studio.
======================================
Box 5707
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I want something new and fresh.
======================================
Box 5708
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I feel so stupid for having had
such idealistic notions about what
business and pleasure are.
======================================
Box 5709
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     People say you should make your
pleasure your business and vice versa
but that only works for non-creative
types.
======================================
Box 5710

[\200 Dogero]
     What brings you joy?
======================================
Box 5711

you like doing that you can't turn a
profit on?
======================================
Box 5712

[\202 Johan]
     What do you like to do?
======================================

--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You can make money doing
anything, so long as you create value.
======================================
Box 5714
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I do art, visual art. Paintings.
======================================
Box 5715
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     It is a means-oriented process,
unlike business. It is about something
inside of me coming out verse
something outside of me coming in.
======================================
Box 5716
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     You aren't making sense.
======================================
Box 5717
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Doing your artwork well is an
ends-oriented process; you have a
finished product in mind that you are
aiming for.
======================================
Box 5718
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     You're just confusing yourself.
======================================
Box 5719
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Incorrect, but that isn't your
aim{}your aim is to justify your
inability to do what you want to do.
======================================
Box 5720
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     No one will ever pay me for what
I want to do. They will only pay me
for what they want me to do.
======================================
Box 5721
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     No one will ever pay me for what
I want to do. They will only pay me
for what they want me to do.

     I am finished with this one,
I am too depressed to start another.

     How much?
======================================
Box 5725

[\202 Johan]
     How much for it?
======================================
Box 5726
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     What are you selling it for?
======================================
Box 5727
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I don't know. I haven't really
tried to sell it. Nobody has been
interested in buying my work.
======================================
Box 5728
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     How about\175 five bits?
======================================
Box 5729
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     That's not that much. I'll take
it.
======================================
Box 5730
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I'll buy it.
======================================
Box 5731
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     That's a lot less than I thought
it would be. I'll take it.
======================================
Box 5732
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     That is not much at all. I will
purchase it.
======================================

======================================
Box 5734

     Wow, that's the first painting
I've ever sold. Not that I'll ever
sell another one\175
======================================
Box 5735
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I can't believe you actually
bought one of my paintings. Five bits
isn't enough to live on though\175
======================================
Box 5736
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     That's okay. I didn't think you
would.
======================================
Box 5737
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     I have a painting you might be
interested in.
======================================
Box 5738
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I have a painting you might be
interested in.
======================================
Box 5739
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     I have a painting you might be
interested in.
======================================

     I have a painting you might be
interested in.
======================================

--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Oh, you do? Well, let me see it.
======================================
Box 5742
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I haven't seen something like
this in a long time. It reminds me of
when I was an aspiring artist.
======================================
Box 5743
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I'll pay you 50$ for it.
======================================
Box 5744
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     That's a lot of bits, thanks!
======================================
Box 5745
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     It's all yours.
======================================

======================================
Box 5747
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     It is a deal.
======================================
Box 5748
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     What a lovely addition to my
collection. I'd buy more of its kind
if there were more.
======================================
Box 5749
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Is 50$ enough?
======================================
Box 5750
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Ha, we sold your painting for
fifty bits!
======================================
Box 5751
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     We sold your painting for ten
times as much as we bought it from
you.
======================================
Box 5752
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Someone else bought one of your
paintings, for ten times as much as
you sold it to us.
======================================

--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     What? Really? Oh my\175
======================================
Box 5754
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Have you ever actually tried to
sell your work?
======================================
Box 5755
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Never tell me again how you can't
mix business with pleasure. I don't
think you put any effort into selling
your work.
======================================
Box 5756
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     The world isn't out to get you{}
you just have to put some effort into
getting what you want.
======================================
Box 5757
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Maybe now you will understand
that it is possible to earn money
doing not what anyone else wants to
do, but what you want to do.
======================================
Box 5758
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I'm such a fool about that.
I never thought it was possible
because\175
======================================
Box 5759
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I don't know why. Maybe I was
scared that things could actually work
out for me? I have to stop living in
fear.
======================================
Box 5760
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Thanks for showing me something
that I would never have realized in my
depressed state. I won't give up on
my dreams so easily this time!
======================================
Box 5761
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     I can't believe I am actually
making money off of what I love to do.
Well, I can, but you know what I mean!

[\234 Dao]
     Now! Fight me!
======================================
Box 5774

[\201 Mi'la]
     I would, but you don't seem like
much of a challenge.
======================================
Box 5775
--------------------------------------
[\234 Dao]
     You don't seem like much of a
fighter. You are afraid to fight me.
======================================
Box 5776
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     I am not.
======================================
Box 5777
--------------------------------------
[\234 Dao]
     I can hear the fear in your
voice.

so be it.
======================================
Box 5802
--------------------------------------
[\234 Dao]
     No.
======================================
Box 5803
--------------------------------------
[\234 Dao]
     To fight me you must remove your
icons.
======================================
Box 5804
--------------------------------------
[\234 Dao]
     I do not believe in them for good
reason: they are inhibitors of one's
own anima and power.
======================================
Box 5805
--------------------------------------
[\234 Dao]
     Return when you are ready to face
me in your true form.
======================================

--------------------------------------
[\234 Dao]
     Excellent.
======================================
Box 5807
--------------------------------------
[\234 Dao]
     By the way you carry yourself,
you have given me enough information
to determine your general strengths
and weaknesses.
======================================
Box 5808
--------------------------------------
[\234 Dao]
     To defeat me, you will have to
show me what you have not shown me
before.
======================================
Box 5809
--------------------------------------
[\234 Dao]
     You must surpass your current
self-imposed limits.
======================================
Box 5810

======================================
Box 5811
--------------------------------------

learned to reject any guilt in being
who you are, in being what you are.

[\219 ????]
     That old castle.
======================================
Box 5946
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     This whole city was built around
it. It was a guard post meant so one
could see Grinlow coming.
======================================
Box 5947
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     The founders of this city built
it during the time of despair, when
Grin was actually roaming the land.
======================================
Box 5948
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     They didn't cower in fear like
everyone else, they prospered. It
makes me proud to live here.
======================================
Box 5949
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     As the story goes, Grinlow came
to tear it down with a vengeance, but
was stopped by the valorians somewhere
nearby. No one knows where exactly.
======================================
Box 5950
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Anyway, the reason I am eyeing
this place is I want to rebuild it.
======================================
Box 5951

     I already bought the property,
and I intend to rent out its rooms to
turn a profit, but I don't have any
capital left to actually fix it up.

     Would you be willing to make an
investment in this place?
======================================
Box 5953

     Before you say anything: I am
asking for 300$ specifically, and will
give you half ownership of the place.
You'll get dividends every five days.
======================================
Box 5954
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     The reason I ask is that I know
I can trust you. It's no secret who
you guys are. At least not to those
who actually care to notice.
======================================
Box 5955
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     So, how about it?

to be a large cavern beneath Cyport.

[\235 Ten]
     Well, I'm just a tad depressed
about things. I feel so weak and
helpless.
======================================
Box 6006
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     There's this one girl, Sparra\175
she hardly ever talks to me anymore.
I miss being with her.
======================================
Box 6007
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     Things just never worked out
between us{}which it was all my fault
for being such a loser.
======================================
Box 6008
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     Maybe you could go check on
Sparra for me, so at least I know
she is happy?
======================================
Box 6009
--------------------------------------
[\225 ????]
     Hi, the name's Sparra, and that's
Talon.
======================================
Box 6010
--------------------------------------
[\224 Talon]
     Any reason you've come to see us?
======================================
Box 6011
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Just getting familiar with the
city's inhabitants. If you want us to
leave, we will.
======================================
Box 6012
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     We're just looking around, seeing
what there is to see in this city.
======================================
Box 6013

[\202 Johan]
     None actually, except we're
curious as to who we can meet and
what there is to see here.
======================================
Box 6014
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     We will leave if you wish.
======================================
Box 6015

[\224 Talon]
     That's okay, you look like
protectors to me. The good kind,
I mean.
======================================
Box 6016
--------------------------------------
[\225 Sparra]
     Yes, it is okay.
======================================
Box 6017
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Ten is curious if you are happy.
======================================
Box 6018
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     A certain Ten is wondering if
you are doing well.
======================================
Box 6019
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     A friend of yours named Ten
wanted to see if you were happy.
======================================
Box 6020
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Ten has asked us to see if you
are happy.
======================================
Box 6021
--------------------------------------
[\225 Sparra]
     Ten! Blah.
======================================
Box 6022
--------------------------------------
[\225 Sparra]
     He still doesn't get it. I
thought we both moved on.
======================================
Box 6023
--------------------------------------
[\225 Sparra]
     Go tell him I am tired of his
stupid depressed whining.
======================================
Box 6024
--------------------------------------
[\225 Sparra]
     Ten's a good guy when not
suicidal. To him, it's like the whole
world is ending and everyone is out to
get him at the same time.
======================================
Box 6025
--------------------------------------
[\224 Talon]
     Today is a good day to work
toward my goals.
======================================
Box 6026
--------------------------------------
[\224 Talon]
     Looks like Ten is still obsessed
with Sparra. I don't think he'll ever
change.
======================================
Box 6027
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     We talked to Sparra for you. She
doesn't seem to like you.
======================================
Box 6028
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Sparra says you're a depressed
whiner. I'd say I have to agree.
======================================
Box 6029
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     She was happy until we told her
you wanted to know how she was.
======================================
Box 6030
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     She was happy before we mentioned
your name.
======================================
Box 6031
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     I see\175 heh.
======================================
Box 6032
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     This depression is not going to
go away. I have never been able to
evade it.
======================================
Box 6033
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     Relationship falling apart, being
the most hated person in Cyport,
betrayed, abandoned and left\175
======================================
Box 6034
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     Nothing will change for the
better. There is nothing good to look
forward to or aim for.
======================================
Box 6035
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Don't say that. Things will
change for the better if you make it
happen.
======================================
Box 6036
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     Don't be such a weakling. You
can get over this.
======================================
Box 6037
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     There has to be something you can
do to get over this.
======================================
Box 6038
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You can change. There must be
something you can do.
======================================
Box 6039
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     There's nothing I can do\175 nothing
to do. I stopped making decisions ages
ago.

crush on?

[\203 Pyrus]

[\235 Ten]
     When she's around me, I'm happy\175
======================================
Box 6050
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     But she's never around, she has
forgotten and abandoned me, like
everyone does.
======================================
Box 6051
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     It's nothing new. I've accepted
who I am.

[\235 Ten]
     Nothing's ever new. Just the same
old nothingness, over and over again.

[\200 Dogero]
     Ten's locked himself inside.
======================================

     I wonder what Ten's up to.
======================================
Box 6055

[\202 Johan]
     Strange, it's locked. Is Ten
okay?
======================================
Box 6056

[\203 Pyrus]
     It appears Ten has locked himself
inside.
======================================
Box 6057

[\225 Sparra]
     He locked himself inside?

it might still work.

been a tad suicidal\175

     I hope Ten's okay. He has always
been a tad suicidal\175
======================================
Box 6062

     Ten's actually a good guy, when
he isn't depressed\175 which lately
hasn't been often.
======================================

     Are you okay?
======================================
Box 6065
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     You okay?
======================================
Box 6066
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Is everything okay? You had us
worried.
======================================
Box 6067
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Is everything alright, Ten?
======================================
Box 6068
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     What can I do to end the pain?
======================================
Box 6069
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     The pain that twists my heart
every second, the never-ending pain
that drives me to insanity\175
======================================
Box 6070
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     To an insanity that makes me want
to stick a knife in my chest.
======================================
Box 6071
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     What is stopping me?
======================================
Box 6072
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     Love.
======================================
Box 6073
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     Ending my pain would cause others
pain; ending my pain would be selfish.
======================================
Box 6074
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     But I can still wish.
======================================
Box 6075
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     Heh. I care about her, but not
myself. I should die.
======================================
Box 6076
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     He's not here.
======================================
Box 6077
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Ten! Hello! You there?
======================================
Box 6078
--------------------------------------
[\201 Mi'la]
     No response. Maybe he's out
sulking somewhere.
======================================
Box 6079
--------------------------------------
[\224 Talon]
     I wonder what's happening.
======================================
Box 6080
--------------------------------------
[\225 Sparra]
     Knowing Ten, he's probably faking
suicide to gain his new friends'
sympathy.
======================================
Box 6081
--------------------------------------
[\224 Talon]
     Think we should go check on them,
just in case?
======================================
Box 6082
--------------------------------------
[\225 Sparra]
     May as well.
======================================
Box 6083
--------------------------------------
[\224 Talon]
     The door is locked. I thought you
gave them a key to open it?
======================================
Box 6084
--------------------------------------
[\225 Sparra]
     This isn't good\175
======================================
Box 6085
--------------------------------------
[\225 Sparra]
     I have another one. I hope he
hasn't done anything he'll regret.
======================================
Box 6086
--------------------------------------

     There's this side of me that
everyone has come to know. The light
shines on it, I show it with pride.
======================================
Box 6087
--------------------------------------

     But then there's everything you
don't know. Everything I cast my
shadow over to disguise.
======================================
Box 6088
--------------------------------------

     Make you think what I want you
to think.
======================================
Box 6089
--------------------------------------

     So you ignore the side that only
a select few people have witnessed.
======================================
Box 6090
--------------------------------------

     All who have seen it hate me.
======================================
Box 6091
--------------------------------------

     Everyone eventually sees it. This
is not the first time, nor the last.
======================================
Box 6092
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     I loved you, yet you come to
betray me like all the others.
======================================
Box 6093
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     Time to die a traitor's death!
======================================
Box 6094
--------------------------------------
[\225 Sparra]
     Look at all the icons on him\175
======================================
Box 6095
--------------------------------------
[\224 Talon]
     That explains his apparent
insanity.
======================================
Box 6096
--------------------------------------
[\225 Sparra]
     I found a key.

Box 6100
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Yes, thank you for rescuing us.
======================================
Box 6101
--------------------------------------
[\224 Talon]
     It's no problem.
======================================
Box 6102

[\201 Mi'la]
     I see you've taken care of Ten.
======================================
Box 6103
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     What happened?
======================================
Box 6104
--------------------------------------
[\225 Sparra]
     Overuse of icons.
======================================
Box 6105
--------------------------------------
[\224 Talon]
     His puppets were full of them.
Somehow he was able to draw energy
from each, paying for it with his
sanity.
======================================
Box 6106
--------------------------------------
[\224 Talon]
     Icons are not toys. The anima
within reflect the souls of beings who
once were; it is dangerous to use more
than one's mind can manage.
======================================
Box 6107
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Is he okay?
======================================
Box 6108
--------------------------------------
[\225 Sparra]
     He should wakeup soon, with a
nasty headache.
======================================
Box 6109
--------------------------------------
[\225 Sparra]
     We'll take care of him until he's
well again, and able to take care of
himself.
======================================
Box 6110
--------------------------------------
[\224 Talon]
     He's not so bad without his
icons. Seems he drew too much support
from them and not enough from himself.
======================================
Box 6111
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     Ugh\175 I feel so weak\175
======================================
Box 6112

[\235 Ten]
     I'm sorry for what I did to you.
I was being very stupid.
======================================
Box 6113
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     Sparra and Talon are very kind
for helping me recover. They didn't
have to, but they did. I guess not
everyone is as bad as I thought.
======================================
Box 6114

[\235 Ten]
     Maybe I'll be happy like them
when I get out of this bed.

     One day a young boy found a
beautiful flower on the side of the
road.
======================================
Box 6312
--------------------------------------

     He wondered what kind of fool
would have left it there to rot,
picked it up, and brought it to his
mother as he thought it suited her.
======================================
Box 6313
--------------------------------------

     She responded to his gift by
screaming, \185BASTARD! GET THAT THING
AWAY FROM ME!'
======================================
Box 6314
--------------------------------------

     The boy was kicked out of his
house and went to live with his uncle.
======================================
Box 6315
--------------------------------------

     His uncle was a famous swordsman
who ran his own school, and needless
to say, the boy became an excellent
swordsman.
======================================
Box 6316
--------------------------------------

     One day he decided to thank his
uncle. He had kept the flower he
found{}which still looked beautiful
to him{}and gave it to his uncle.
======================================
Box 6317
--------------------------------------

     He responded by screaming, \185YOU
INGRATE, IT IS PEOPLE LIKE YOU WHO
MAKE OUR FAMILY LOOK INFERIOR!'
======================================
Box 6318

     The boy was expelled from his
uncle's school.

     In a chance encounter several
years later, the boy received a
fabulous job. Every four seasons, he
was to be paid two thousand gold bits.
======================================
Box 6320
--------------------------------------

     The day he was to receive his
first payment, the boy decided to
thank his boss as best he could.

     He brought him the flower, which
after all these years looked beautiful
to him.
======================================

     \185YOU ARE FIRED, YOU BASTARD!'
yelled his boss.
======================================
Box 6323

     The now jobless boy walked to his
home in sadness and was confronted by
a homeless man.
======================================
Box 6324
--------------------------------------

     The homeless man said to him,
\185Hey, I read something about that rare
flower you have there! I can tell you
all about it later tonight.'
======================================
Box 6325
--------------------------------------

     The boy went to his home and
waited eagerly. He saw a single flash
in the window.

     Hours later, growing impatient,
he saw two bright flashes in
succession.

hit his window.

Box 6345
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     Not by all. I was fortunate
enough to have access to an old tome
that briefly mentioned your existence.
======================================
Box 6346
--------------------------------------
[\236 Nix]
     And what did it say?
======================================
Box 6347
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     You betrayed the others and
mysteriously disappeared.
======================================
Box 6348
--------------------------------------
[\236 Nix]
     Your tome lies; they betrayed me.
======================================

me remain, let me die in full.
======================================
Box 6356
--------------------------------------
[\236 Nix]
     I died for you all, and have been
miserable\175
======================================
Box 6357
--------------------------------------

     I have been miserable my whole
life.
======================================
Box 6358
--------------------------------------

     Everything I did was for others.
I neglected myself in life, and I
suffer in death.
======================================

     Before I died, I had my own
following.
======================================

     They no longer bring me comfort.
I don't think they ever did.
======================================
Box 6361

     They built a temple around my
tomb, to receive my blessings. Little
did they know my tomb would become
as cold as my heart and kill them all.
======================================
Box 6362
--------------------------------------

     None of them wanted to live;
they lived not wanting to die.
======================================

you too.

of helping others.

cold tomb, I am tired of doing

     Where is Mi'la, anyway? I haven't
seen her since after the race.
======================================
Box 6772
--------------------------------------
[\232 Cap]
     My mom says I have too much
energy and too little self-control.
It's her fault for grounding me and
not letting me enter the race!
======================================

     That was some fine running you
showed us today. I am looking forward
to see how you turn out as an adult.
======================================

     I knew you could do it! You
looked so determined and serious out
there, it was cute.
======================================
Box 6775
--------------------------------------
[\238 Dow]
     What did I tell you? Those who
didn't think ahead tripped up, while
you and Mi'la kept a steady pace and
won.
======================================
Box 6776
--------------------------------------
[\225 Integrity]
     I love and hate nights like this.
Everything feels fine with the world,
but I know once I wake up, this will
only have been a passing dream.
======================================
Box 6777

     If you ever find yourself
doubting life like me sometimes, think

     Go enjoy yourself, dear. What
you experience today will shape who
you will be for the rest of your life.
======================================

--------------------------------------
[\220 Nanny]
     You should get some sleep, dear.
Don't be like me and allow a sea of
regrets to keep you up at night.
======================================
Box 6780

     I finally asked my mom what
happened to my dad, and she didn't
answer. Something's not right, man.
======================================
Box 6781
--------------------------------------

     I wonder if not knowing our
parents will hurt us later. It is
like not having a past to stand on.
======================================
Box 6782
--------------------------------------

     Whoever my parents were, I bet
they were one of the people to finally
stop Grinlow. I have awesome in my
blood!
======================================
Box 6783
--------------------------------------
[\204 Missy]
     Sometimes, when I think about
what I lost, I wonder if life was ever
worth living. What does it matter if
things can be so easily destroyed?
======================================
Box 6784
--------------------------------------

bright future. Life has its highs and
lows, but it is all worth it in the

Box 6785

======================================
Box 6786
--------------------------------------
[\238 Lucid]
     The sun feels warm, the flowers
smell fresh, but I always have this
nagging sense that something is
missing. Must be my old age.
======================================
Box 6787
--------------------------------------
[\220 Nanny]
     When I was your age, I lived in
a city. When a lot of people live so
close to one another, bad things tend
to happen.
======================================
Box 6788
--------------------------------------
[\204 Missy]
     I've used the word love a lot,
but the meaning is always on the tip
of my tongue. It is something more
than liking someone!
======================================
Box 6789
--------------------------------------
[\238 Dow]
     Dogero, I think of you as a son.
There will come a time when I won't be
around, and I hope you'll be ready.

     Never lose sight of what makes
you proud to be alive.
======================================
Box 6791
--------------------------------------
[\225 Integrity]
     I used to have a boyfriend back
in the Grinlow days. I teased him a
lot, but never told him how I felt.
Nothing but regret now\175
======================================
Box 6792
--------------------------------------
[\238 Lucid]
     There will come a time in your
life when your knees give up on you,
and you'll have that age old choice:
do you run, ignore, or confront?
======================================
Box 6793
--------------------------------------
[\238 Lucid]
     Wish I could make that choice
again.
======================================
Box 6794
--------------------------------------
[\220 Nanny]
     Keep this a secret between us:
I am afraid to sleep in my old age,
because one night I might not wake up.
Life is meant to go on forever.
======================================
Box 6795

     Mi'la is such a loser, man. She
talks big and has nothing to show for
it.
======================================

     Kidding around is a fun way to
kill time, though I wish I had
something better to do.
======================================

     Flowers, flowers, I could stomp

     I've heard someone spotted a
monster in the woods. You're not
invincible, so don't do anything rash,
okay?
======================================
Box 6799
--------------------------------------
[\220 Nanny]
     Promise me something, Dogero.
Don't become an old hag like me. Life
is worth too much to waste without
ever having used it.

about this: you show us how and we
make them.

[\230 Spunk]
     I'm fine. I just owed you one for
opening my eyes.
======================================
Box 7192
--------------------------------------
[\230 Spunk]
     I owed myself one. Those things
did the most\175 damage in the waves of
monsters that attacked Cyport.
======================================
Box 7193
--------------------------------------
[\230 Spunk]
     To hell with fairness.
Everything's even now.
======================================
Box 7194
--------------------------------------
[\230 Spunk]
     It is good and right to finally
bring the fight here, to attack the
source.
======================================
Box 7195

[\219 ????]
     I don't feel like talking.
======================================

here used to make something. Now we
rot in Rorc.
======================================
Box 7197
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Hey you, I have something to
show you.
======================================
Box 7198
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     It is a map of Shoda's Tomb
I made.
======================================
Box 7199
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     Freeing that man chained to the
gates freed me as well. I don't plan
to stay much longer, I remain only to
see you find what you are looking for.
======================================
Box 7200
--------------------------------------
[\219 ????]
     For the first time in a long
time, I want to see someone succeed.
======================================
Box 7201
--------------------------------------
[\226 ????]
     I'm rooting for you, and I think
a lot more people are too, though they
don't show it much.
======================================
Box 7202
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     Hey, it is great to see you!
I knew you'd make your way here sooner
or later, you're just those kind of
people.
======================================
Box 7203
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     I used to be like you until I
became a protector. After a lot of
thought in this dreary place, I
decided I want to be myself again.
======================================
Box 7204
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     As such, I've embraced my old
virtues.
======================================
Box 7205
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     If you want the best icons money
and mind can create, ask me and I'll
make them!
======================================
Box 7206
--------------------------------------
[\212 Plug]
     Ready for the best?
======================================
Box 7207

[\212 Plug]
     My passions influence my design,
and I have found they work best when
kept pure.
======================================
Box 7208

[\212 Plug]
     I haven't finished the one you
ordered yet, but if you like, I can
begin work on a new one.
======================================

Box 7210
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     I came as soon as I heard you had
left Cyport.
======================================
Box 7211
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     I want to fight monsters like
you, but I'm not strong enough. I can
still fight indirectly by assisting
you though, which is why I'm here.
======================================
Box 7212
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     If you have any injuries, I can
heal you. Sparra and Talon taught me
while I was recovering.
======================================
Box 7213
--------------------------------------
[\235 Ten]
     Do you need medical treatment
or sleep?
======================================
Box 7214

     I'll be here as long as you need
my help.

[\224 Jack]
     Hey gang, how's it going?
======================================
Box 7217
--------------------------------------
[\200 Dogero]
     Fine, yourself?
======================================
Box 7218

======================================
Box 7219
--------------------------------------
[\202 Johan]
     Great, how about you?
======================================
Box 7220
--------------------------------------
[\203 Pyrus]
     It is going as expected for the
most part.
======================================
Box 7221
--------------------------------------
[\224 Jack]
     Well, as for me, this place is
no Cyport. I can't wait to leave.
======================================
Box 7222

[\225 Keel]
     Hello.
======================================
Box 7223
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     I apologize for how I acted back
in Cyport.
======================================
Box 7224
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     I've been thinking a lot about
you, more of what you stand for, what
you represent in light of everything
I had come to accept.
======================================
Box 7225
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     I'm no fighter, I never was. But
what I was good at was encouragement.
======================================
Box 7226
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     I'm here to see you defeat the
source. I know you can do it.
======================================
Box 7227
--------------------------------------
[\225 Keel]
     When all of this is finished
over here, I plan to go back to Cyport
and become an artist. I want to paint
pictures that glorify life.
======================================
Box 7228

[\234 ????]

are not ready for me.

[\234 Dao]
     I am willing to train your mind
and body to their limits.
======================================

     Such training I have not given
even unto my lowly and laughable{}
though good-hearted{}pupils in Cyport.

     You shall be my first.

[\234 Dao]
     I am aware I come off as
eccentric and crazy, every great
person does, including you!
======================================

[\234 Dao]
     I have trained you all to your
limits.

you.

     Now, I understand who you are.
======================================

======================================
Box 7253
--------------------------------------
[\219 Artikolist]
     I came out here to perfect my
craft in solitude, but solitude became
loneliness, and I soon found myself
under Gahn's spell.

to bear my icons.

     Do you have need of my craft?
======================================
Box 7259

     Gahn is the father of icon
crafting. I have heard he is able to
mold icons into swords. I wonder what
else he is capable of\175

is good, but are really disappointed
when they actually play it.
======================================

     Were you disappointed? If so,
you're a sick freak for getting here.
I mean, do you enjoy feeling let down?
Quit playing already!

======================================
Box 7940
--------------------------------------
[RinkuHero]
     A person has a general sense of
how their life (thus the world) works,
certain expectancies.
======================================
Box 7941
--------------------------------------
[RinkuHero]
     If it's overly pessimistic, they
think of their lives and the world
cynically, as something worthless,
something that is based on suffering.
======================================
Box 7942
--------------------------------------
[RinkuHero]
     Then on the other side of the
spectrum they might be overly
optimistic, they think of their lives
and the world as things where anything
is possible to their wills.
======================================
Box 7943
--------------------------------------
[RinkuHero]
     Where reality bends to their
orders, since they know how reality
works and thus how to manipulate it.
======================================
Box 7944
--------------------------------------
[RinkuHero]
     I.e., they have a benevolent
universe premise, and see the universe
as something fit for human life,
something that it's a good thing to
live in.
