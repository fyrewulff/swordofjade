WHAT IS NEW?

September 13 2021 [Hróðvitnir]

  *** New Features
    * Slice Editor:
      * Settings/tools menu (F8 to open). Lists most hotkeys. Includes new
        settings to show/hide the position and size of each slice. [Ralph]
      * Data organised into collapsible/expandable sections [Sword]
      * Press F in the slice editor to focus on a slice [Ralph]
      * Slice collections can be named. The name and collection ID are shown in
        the in-game slice debugger [Ralph]
      * In the position/size edit view hold Ctrl to change size/position instead
    * F8 debug menu option "Enable/Disable random battles" [Ralph]
    * Better, smoother screen fading in/out [Ralph]
    * Option (in General Settings Menu) to run in 24-bit color mode. Much nicer
      looking transparent sprites, but increases CPU usage [Ralph]
    * Attacks can have custom alignment relative to their targets [James]
    * There is now a global pool of NPC definitions that can be used on
      any map to supplement the local per-map NPCs [James]
    * Turn-based battle bit "Don't break Speed ties randomly" [Ralph]
    * "Ignore MP~ stat" general preference bit, so you can use the stat for
      something else [Ralph]
    * The new gfx_sdl2 and music_sdl2 backends based on SDL 2 & SDL_mixer 2 are
      now the default on Windows, 64-bit Mac and Linux/Unix. These fix many
      problems in gfx_sdl and music_sdl. gfx_sdl2 requires Windows XP or later.
      You can switch backend, to gfx_directx or (obsolete) gfx_fb, with Ctrl-F7.
      There's no reason to prefer music_sdl, but if you want to use gfx_sdl,
      which was the default on Unix/Linux/Mac and the default for Custom on
      Windows, you will need to download/compile a "music_sdl" build or 32-bit
      Mac build.
      [Ralph]
    * When using gfx_sdl2, gamepads should now work reliably: A is Use, B is
      Cancel/Menu, Start is Menu, and you can use new joy:button constants like
      joy:A, joy:LeftStick, joy:L2 for keypress commands, and axis:X, axis:RightY,
      axis:L2, etc. for "joystick axis".
      And when multiple gamepads are plugged in all of them should work [Ralph]
    * Preference bitset "Map joystick (left) stick to dpad" (default on) [Ralph]
    * You can copy/paste enemies and attacks by pressing Ctrl-C, etc, on the
      <- Enemy/Attack ## -> line [Ralph]
    * Shift+F# alternative keycombos to Ctrl+F# debug keys, so you can activate
      them without accidentally activating NPCs/etc [Ralph]
    * "Don't display 'Miss'" and "Don't display 'Fail'" attack bits [Ralph]

   * New Plotscripting Features
    * "set timer args" [Ralph]
    * "sl:walkabout sprite" alias to "sl:walkabout sprite component" and
      "sl:walkabout shadow" alias to "sl:walkabout shadow component"
    * "get scancode name" works for joy: scancodes too [Ralph]
    * "expand strings in slices" [James]
    * "hero is chasing" and "npc is chasing" [James]
    * "max map id" [James]
    * "get slice lookup name" [Ralph]
    * "create global npc", "global npc reference" (and alias "global npc"),
      "get npc pool" [James]
    * Commands that now accept an optional "pool" argument:
      "alter npc", "npc reference", "npc copy count", "change npc id",
      "create npc", "read npc" [James]
    * "gracefully dismount vehicle" [James]
    * "read foemap" [Ralph]
    * "breakpoint" [Ralph]
    * "delete hero by slot" [James]
    * "get ui color", "set ui color", "get box style color",
      "get box style edge color", "get box style border" [Ralph]
    * "get child autosort", "set child autosort" [Ralph]
    * "last layer id", "layer id under walkabouts" [James]
    * "get/set global sound volume" [Ralph]

  *** Changes
    * NPCpush:vertical and NPCpush:horizontal script constants were swapped with
      with each other! They've been swapped the right way. This fix only takes
      effect when you reimport your scripts.
    * MP~/Focus and Hits stats are no longer limited to 100 and 20 in the editors
    * Joystick buttons 2 and 3 are no longer mapped to Use/Cancel (like buttons 0
      and 1), so you can use them for other purposes
    * The 'joystick num' args to various script commands were replaced with
      'player' args which are similar, except joysticks are now numbered from 1
      instead of 0. 0 means "any joystick".
    * The slice editor now shows the root slice of a collection by default
    * "trim string" now trims tabs and newlines too
    * "menu key" and "cancel key" are now different constants. "menu key"
      includes the Start button on a gamepad
    * Module (.mod/xm/it/s3m) music volume level has changed. Unfortunately the
      volume level differs by OS, SDL_mixer version and SDL_mixer backend
      library, and previously changed in Dwimmercrafty (2017):
                                 Windows            Mac/Linux/Android
        music_sdl2, now:         medium (modplug)   medium (modplug)
        music_sdl, now:          medium (modplug)   quiet  (mikmod)
        music_sdl, 2017-2020:    loud   (modplug)   quiet  (mikmod)
        music_sdl, before 2017:  quiet  (mikmod)    quiet  (mikmod)
    * Games packed as Windows installers install into Program Files\ not
      Program Files\OHRRPGCE Games\

  *** Bugfixes
    * "set opacity" (with opacity < 100%) didn't always turn on blending
      [Ralph]
    * Bug #1118 In turn-based battles, non-blocking attacks delayed by X
      attacks could delay by up to X turns. You have to turn off the "Non-turn
      attack delays can also cause turn delays" back-compatibility bit to get
      this bugfix [Ralph]
    * Experience required to level is no longer shown in the Status screen
      for heroes that reached max level. If all heroes are at max level,
      battles no longer tell that you gained experience [Ralph]
    * Damage and level caps changes didn't update in saved games. This fix
      only affects new saves, old ones still remember the old caps [Ralph]
    * Wrong victory animation when battle ends while hero is walking [Ralph]
    * In the slice editor, Ctrl+Up/Down and Shift+Up/Down made the cursor move
      two places [Ralph]
    * Sprites imported from PNGs had the last palette color set to black [Ralph]
    * Wrong default palette in spriteset browser after importing a frame [Ralph]
    * "load palette" reverted often when using Test Game or debug menus [Ralph]
    * Deleting tilesets didn't delete default passability or animations, and
      the tilesets reappeared, blanked out, when quitting & reloading [Ralph]
    * Foemap Stats menu partly ignored enemy 0, and several minor bugs [Ralph]
    * Saving in a hidden save slot with a script will not move the default
      cursor to the very bottom of the save/load menu anymore [James]
    * On Macs, games set to run at 60fps (or close to 60) actually ran at a much
      lower framerate. Shift-Tab also works much better on Mac now. [Ralph]
    * Transparency effects resulted in random colors (unless "update palette"
      was called) in games that didn't use the default master palette [Ralph]
    * Bug #1138 64-bit Mac builds show black screen when fullscreened, and also
      bug #1142 possible extreme lag/freezing on 64-bit Mac [James]
    * If you had more than about 3321 textboxes, Page Down in the textbox
      browser was broken [Ralph]
    * NPC extra data wasn't saved in saved map states (they reset to 0) [Ralph]
    * Bug #1143 4-bit BMP export with width mod 4 == 1 is broken, and
      bug #1070 Master palette export produces a semi-broken BMP file [Ralph]
    * Zone maps could be saved incorrectly on width-256 and larger maps [Ralph]
    * Poison/regen/mute/stun status icon characters were pointlessly saved in
      save games, so didn't update if you changed them
    * "check parentage" was completely broken [Ralph]
    * Bug #1145 on Mac spawning HSpeak to import scripts randomly failed [Ralph]
    * Mac: music & sfx menus didn't show metadata for .ogg files [Ralph]
    * When using the new default gfx_sdl2/music_sdl2 backends, the following
      bugs are fixed:
      * #372 music_sdl: segmentation fault on 11025Hz MP3 files (affects old
        games containing MP3s on Mac/Linux)
      * #1085 SDL_mixer plays tracks slowed down/sped up if not 11, 22 or 44.1kHz
      * #1187 module (XM/MOD/IT/S3M) loop points didn't work on Linux and Mac
      * #1136 music_sdl: Crash when playing a truncated .wav
      * #1079 Linux: Occasional freeze when quitting when using PulseAudio
      * #617 Screen tearing on some computers (didn't affect gfx_directx)
      * #1140 64-bit Mac gfx_sdl: Random crash in SDL_SoftStretch
      * #1147 64-bit Mac gfx_sdl: run-away memory leak
      * #1115 Linux gfx_sdl: can't resize the window on Xfce
      * #1173 Windows gfx_sdl: Enter key stuck after changing window zoom level
        in Custom
      * On a multimonitor Unix/X11 system game windows could get created larger
        than a single monitor
    * Many bugs fixed in gfx_sdl2, which was previously experimental [Ralph]
    * The currency global text string wasn't used for attack harm text or cost
      descriptions [Ralph]
    * If the player unequips something when there's no room in the inventory they
      now get the "No room" message instead of losing the equipment (other
      methods of unequipping still destroy the item!) [Ralph]
    * Bug #1137 crashes and "BUG: missing sprite component" errors when swapping
      heroes immediately before a map change [James]
    * Tweaked battle target cursor movement to fix some (but not all) odd
      behaviour and a possibility of unselectable targets! [Ralph]
    * Bug #38 Virus scanners raise false alarm on game.exe when a game icon is
      embedded while distributing a game. Most virus scanners stopped reporting
      a false positive anyway, but we now use a fixed embedding tool that sets
      the correct .exe checksum [Ralph]

  *** Stuff Only Developers Will Notice
    * clang can be used to compile instead of gcc. Added "compiler=clang|gcc"
      flag to scons [Ralph]
    * hspeak now built using eubind instead of euc in debug builds; using eubind
      avoids linker errors when compiling Euphoria->C on recent Linux distros


May 2 2020 [Gorgonzola]

  *** New Features
    * True transparent sprite and map layer slices!
      You can control opacity and blend mode: normal, add or multiply.
      Blending works by mapping to the nearest master palette color, which
      is fast-enough but sometimes looks poor; there's a global setting to
      control how that's done. (Press Ctrl-F3 in the slice editor to preview
      what future 32-bit blending will look like!) [Ralph]
    * New dissolve/appear animations: Fade, Ghostly fade, Fade to white,
      Puff, Fade up, Blip [Ralph]
    * Numlock is now respected in both Game and Custom; when it's off numpad
      keys are also mapped to other keys, so you can use the numpad for
      movement.  When it's on, no remapping happens. (You can disable
      remapping with Ctrl-Shift-N.) [Ralph]
    * "Dead Foe (dead heroes only)" and "Foe (including dead heroes)" attack
      target classes [Ralph]
    * Title Screen Text; a quick and easy way to put a line of text like
      a version number at the bottom of the title screen [James]
    * "Reset UI Colors/Box Styles to defaults" options in the Master Palettes
      menu, and Ctrl-D rescue key [Ralph]
    * Enemy editor option to show a backdrop behind the enemy sprite [Ralph]
    * While encoding .ogg files, added an advanced option not to filter out
      very high frequencies. Useful for sfx (eg rain) with hiss noises [Ralph]

   * New Plotscripting Features
    * ""any key", etc, includes mouse" option in Mouse Controls menu [Ralph]
    * "get scancode name" [Ralph]
    * "get hero slice by slot", "get hero sprite by slot",
      "hero slot from slice" [Ralph]
    * Global script triggers for when a hero is added, deleted, or swapped to
      a different slot [Ralph]
    * "get opacity", "set opacity", "get blend mode", "set blend mode",
      "get blending enabled", "set blending enabled" [Ralph]
    * "set rect opacity", "get rect opacity", and trans:blend constant for
      "set rect trans" [Ralph]

  *** Changes
    * Renamed "Enemy" target class to "Foe (not dead)", and "Ally" to
      "Ally (not dead)"
    * Empty active party slots no longer have hidden dummy hero slices, while
      reserve party heroes *do* have slices, so hero slices are now preserved
      until you save and reload the game. They're parented to a new hidden
      'Reserve' special slice [Ralph]

  *** Bugfixes
    * Linux builds should now hopefully work on all Linux systems since 2011
      (as long as SDL & SDL_mixer are installed) [Ralph]
    * On Windows, copy-pasting text caused spaces to be added at line ends,
      and near-full textboxes couldn't be copy-pasted [Ralph]
    * sf#2045: "Lost HP (target)" base attack stat was always 0 [Ralph]
    * Weapon pictures/palettes didn't update in saved games and Test Game
      after a weapon was edited [Ralph]
    * Script IDs could change when you reimported scripts, breaking script
      IDs stored in saved games (didn't affect Test Game) [Ralph]
    * OK, now you can *actually* import .wav files as music.
    * You couldn't import .wav or .mp3 files on Mac OS 10.15 (the utilities
      were still 32-bit) [Ralph]
    * A few fixes for heroes with negative HP not counting as dead when using
      spells outside of battle [Ralph]
    * Bug 1105 "Self"- and "Ally not Self"-target attacks are treated as
      "Ally"-target attacks outside of battle [Ralph]
    * Caterpillar party heroes overlapped when hero speed didn't divide evenly
      into 20, even with "Keep caterpillar length the same" on [Ralph]
    * "any key" was pressed when numlock/scrolllock/capslock were on [Ralph]
    * State of numlock and capslock keys was wrong in various cases [Ralph]
    * Crash when switching between gfx backends (switching to gfx_sdl) [Ralph]
    * When heroes are swapped between active party slots their slices are
      now swapped too, instead of just the sprites changing [Ralph]
    * "create sprite" always returned 0 [Bena, Ralph]
    * --scriptlog commandline arg didn't work
    * If "Do not hide leader" vehicle bit was on, "Do not hide party" was
      ignored [Ralph]
    * Windows gfx_sdl2 builds failed to add SDL2.dll to packaged games [Ralph]
    * Innosetup (to create installer .exe) download no longer worked, at least
      on some Windows OSes [Ralph]
    * Fix possible "Can't find unzip tool" error on Windows when trying to
      distribute a game in a .zip file [Ralph]
    * Couldn't package games for Linux from recent Windows 10 versions [Ralph]
    * The FreeBSD port didn't compile [Ralph]
    * When upgrading some pre-Beelzebufo (2013) .rpgs new UI colors were
      initialised to nonsense values [Ralph]
    * Imported images with height or width above 2048 would crash [Ralph]
    * Possible crash in slice editor when switching collections [Ralph]
    * Crash when viewing Map from inside a shop [Ralph]
    * Bug #1106 Space and Ctrl cause Enter to appear pressed, Alt causes ESC
      to appear pressed [Ralph]
    * Fix various crashes or BUG messages in (generally very old) corrupt .rpg
      files [Ralph]

  *** Stuff Only Developers Will Notice
    * All .py build scripts and utilities will run under Python 3 as well as
      Python 2 [Daniel Würl, Ralph]


January 12 2020 [Fufluns]

  Highlights:
    * Games can be played with mouse or (mostly working) joystick
    * Spritesets and backdrops can be any size
    * Hero counter-attacks
    * Hero MP meters
    * Graphical browsers for sprites, attacks, enemies, maps, textboxes, etc.
    * Enemy Usage and Foemap Statistics screens
    * Menu item colors and real unselectable menu items
    * Line slices
    * PNG, JPEG importing

  *** New Features

   * Graphics and Slices
    * Spritesets and backdrops can be any size! E.g. walkabouts can be larger
      than 20x20 [Ralph]
    * You can now import PNG and JPEG images as well as BMP (they're
      decompressed on import, so beware of importing large images) [Ralph]
    * Screenshots saved as PNGs instead of BMPs (but when using gfx_directx
      the Screenshot setting in the Options menu has priority) [Ralph]
    * When importing a backdrop or tileset from an unpaletted image, can use
      dithering for hopefully-better conversion to your master palette [Ralph]
    * Minimaps look much better. Also, you can change the minimap generation
      method in the General Game Settings menu, with four options [Ralph]
    * You can adjust the number of ticks per walkabout animation frame in
      General Game Settings [Ralph]
    * Rect slices can now be "truly" alpha-transparent (but blend results are
      still limited to the master palette) [Ralph]
    * Added fuzzy rect slice settings: fuzzy zoom, stationary pattern [Ralph]
    * Line slices [Ralph]
    * "Camera following a hero/NPC centers on..." general setting to control
      which part of a tall walkabout to center on [Ralph]

   * In-game User Interface, Controls
    * Mouse Options menu allows you to enable built-in mouse support for
      walking around on maps, activating NPCs, using menus and special
      screens and in battles. [James]
    * Joystick controls should now work everywhere in-game again - been broken
      for over a decade! However not all gamepads are supported yet: only ones
      with ABXY buttons numbered 0-3. [Ralph]
      * New general bitset "Map joystick controls to keyboard keys for scripts"
        (ON by default) allows existing scripts which check keyboard keys
        key:enter, key:esc, and key:left/right/up/down to work when the
        player uses a joystick.
    * In General Map Settings you can disable access to the main menu [Ralph]
    * Added a general bitset to hide empty save slots at the bottom of the
      save/load menu. (Won't shows less than 4 slots unless you specifically
      set a max lower than 4) [James]
    * Max number of save slots increased from 32 to 1000 [James]
    * "Can't be selected" subtype for "Label" menu items. (The "Caption"
      item type is renamed "Label", and the old badly named "Unselectable"
      subtype is renamed "Disabled") [Ralph]
    * In user-defined menus each menu item can now have its own color and
      'disabled' color [Ralph]
    * All the fade-out colors are now customisable User Interface Colors [Ralph]
    * Displaying "x1" after singular items in the inventory is now optional
      (in General Game Settings) [Ralph]
    * Shops requiring trade-ins tell how many of the item you have [Ralph]
    * More flexible Money global text string, e.g. "$9" instead of "9 $" [Ralph]

   * Map Editor Features
    * Added a "wall display style" setting to the passmap editor; walls now
      pulse rather than flash, and there's a new "outlined" style [Ralph]
    * Option to show outline of the in-game screen size in the map editor so
      you can check what will be visible. Press Ctrl-O once/twice or toggle in
      the Map Editor Settings menu. [Ralph]
    * The map picker shows a preview of each map [Ralph]
    * Press G in NPC placement mode to select NPC type under cursor, and C to
      cycle through NPC instances [Ralph]
    * Can delete NPCs from the NPCs-on-this-tile menu [Ralph]
    * Foemap Statistics submenu (see below)
    * Editor Settings to show NPCs in all edit modes, draw NPCs below overhead
      layers, and hide the Hero start location [Ralph]

   * Other Editors
    * New spriteset editor [Ralph]
    * Add the ability to browse for Attacks, Enemies, Heroes, Textboxes,
      Shops, stuff in shops, Sound Effects, Songs. [James]
    * You can press Ctrl+F or click the "Filter" button to filter/search the
      'thingbrowser' screen by name. [James]
    * Re-organised various menus, especially Attack Bitsets menu and the
      General Game Settings menu:
      * General Preference/Battle/Backcompat bitsets rearranged - all battle-
        related bitsets have been moved into the Battle System Options menu.
        Some bits have been renamed and now all Backcompat Bits are
        off by default in new games; if one of them is on then you know you're
        missing out on some feature or bugfix [Ralph]
    * Most editors updated to display better at resolutions > 320x200. Sprite
      editor still the glaring omission. [James, Ralph]
    * Much nicer interactive stat preview graph in the Hero Stats menu [Ralph]
    * Can create an enemy/hero formation as a copy of an existing one [Ralph]
    * Copy/pasting of item definitions [Ralph] 
    * Copy/pasting of palettes inside the palette browser [Ralph]
    * See how long you've been working on your game in General Game Settings
      (starts counting from zero with Fufluns) [Ralph]
    * Previewing MP3 files in the file browser reenabled (Windows only) [Ralph]
    * You can preview hero formations with hero sprites [Ralph]
    * Enemy Usage menu shows where an enemy is used, and chance of encountering
      it, and Foemap Statistics menu shows chance of each encounter [Ralph]

   * Battle Features
    * Hero MP meter, along bottom of the HP meter. Disabled by default in
      existing games. [Sword, Ralph]
    * You can now pick the color used to display damage, healing, absorb
      poison and regen in battle. You can also override the color
      in the attack editor. [James]
    * "Shrink to Center" dissolve animation [James]
    * "Screen Center" attack animation [James]
    * Heroes can have intrinsic counter-attacks just like Enemies [James]
    * Attack option to control whether counterattacks are triggered on a hit,
      miss or fail, with a global default in Battle System Options menu [Ralph]
    * New attack target class: "Counter (last to hit attacker)", which you
      should normally use for counterattacks instead of "Revenge" [Ralph]
    * Added missing attack target class "All (including dead heroes)" [Ralph]
    * New bitset "Cap minimum stats to zero" can prevent equipment with
      negative stat bonuses from making a hero's stats negative [James]
    * All stat caps and equipment stat bonuses can now be up to 32767 [Ralph]
    * Option to give rewards from an enemy before it is transmogrified [Ralph]
    * In turn-based mode negative attack delays are now allowed, to make the
      attack jump ahead in the turn-order queue [Ralph]
    * Turn-based battles bitset to disallow cancelling/changing a hero's attack
      [Ralph]
    * Enemy spawning option to allow multi-elemental attacks to trigger multiple
      on-hit elemental spawning conditions, not just the first [Ralph]
    * "Useable in battle from spell lists" attack bit (default on) [Ralph]

   * Debug Keys and Live-previewing
    * Ctrl-F2 and Ctrl-F3 debug keys to access save/load menus [Ralph]
    * Ctrl-F8 to view debug log (works everywhere in Game/Custom)
      (Changing graphics backend now Ctrl-F7 instead of Ctrl-F8).  [Ralph]
    * In-battle instant-run debug key moved from Ctrl-F4 to Ctrl-F5, because
      Ctrl-F4 now shows slice debug menu in battles (not useful yet)
    * Debug menu option "Show/test any battle formation" [Ralph]
    * Shop stock levels in saved games and when Testing Game are now updated if
      you edit the things in a shop - reset if needed, or increased/decreased
      to reflect the change [Ralph]
    * Vehicles are reloaded while using Test Game [Ralph]
    * While using Test Game, a "Record combined editor+player .gif" option
      appears in the editor's F9 Global Options menu [Ralph]

  * Misc Features
    * Added a crash reporter (CrashRpt) on Windows (not included when
      distributing a game), which makes it trivial for you to send a report if
      a crash or a bug is detected. Towards a bug-free future! [Ralph]
    * Maximum Shop ID has been raised from 99 to 32767 [James]
    * You can share save files between games by overriding the name of the
      .saves folder (useful if you create additional .rpg files which are
      sequels, variants (eg a Hardtype) or have bonus content) [Ralph]
    * Windows 95 is supported again! (But hspeak doesn't run on 95; upgrade to
      Windows 98) [Ralph]
    * New graphics backend gfx_sdl2 (and music_sdl2). Better fullscreen handling
      than gfx_sdl. Only available in non-default nightly builds for now [Ralph]
    * "Ignore harmtiles" vehicle bit [Ralph]
    * Preference bitset "Negative-damage harmtiles can cure above max HP"
      (defaults to on) [Ralph]

  * New Plotscripting Features
    * "save screenshot" [Ralph]
    * "append number": added "min length" and "pad with zeroes" args [Ralph]
    * "use door": added "fade screen" argument, so you can use a door without
      fading [Ralph]
    * "npc copy number" (inverse of "npc reference") [Ralph]
    * "npc reference" can find tag-disabled NPCs with new "allow disabled" arg
      [Ralph]
    * "create line", "slice is line", "get line color", "set line color" [Ralph]
    * "force mount vehicle", "current vehicle id", "current vehicle npc" [James]
    * Missing constants for "get/set menu item subtype":
      menulabel:selectable, menulabel:disabled, menulabel:unselectable,
      menuspecial:map always, menuspecial:save always, menuspecial:margins,
      menuspecial:purchases, menuspecial:windowed, menuspecial:fullscreen,
      menuspecial:music volume, menuspecial:sound volume,
      and menutype:caption alias for menutype:label,
      and alias "menuitembit:close menu when activated",
      and missing constant "menubit:remember selection" [Ralph]
    * "get/set menu cancel button menu" and "get/set menu item spacing" [Ralph]
    * "menu item disabled", "menu item visible", "menu item selectable" [Ralph]
    * "get/set menu disabled textcolor", "get/set menu item color",
      "get/set menu item disabled color" [Ralph]
    * "last menu item", "menu item count", "visible menu item count" [Ralph]
    * "close menu" gains "run close script" argument [Ralph]
    * "pathfind hero to", "hero chases npc" and "cancel hero walk" [James]
    * NPCstat:pathfindingrule constant for "read npc"/"alter npc"
    * "speaking npc" [Ralph]
    * "read preference bit", "write preference bit" [Ralph]
    * "pick hero" has two new args to let you pick the prompt message, and to

    * hspeak is several times faster when compiling very large scripts [Ralph]
    * "set last save slot" [Ralph]
    * All key commands accept all key constants - no more hassles! You can pass
      "any key", "use key", etc, to "key is pressed", "keyval" and "wait for
      scancode", and pass key: and joy: constants to "wait for key" [Ralph]
    * Added key:AnyEnter, key:Meta/key:WinLogo/key:Command, "run key",
      "joy:button 17" to "joy:button 32", and joy:up/down/left/right
      (aliases to "joy:y up", etc)
    * Long-missing "keypress" and "new keypress" commands: you should often use
      these instead of "key is pressed" and "keyval" [Ralph]
    * "keyval" now takes the joystick number as a second argument (for use
      with joy: key constants), like "key is pressed" did [Ralph]
    * "get joystick name", "joystick button count", "joystick axis count",
      "joystick hat count" (only works with gfx_sdl/gfx_sdl2 currently) [Ralph]

  *** Changes
    * Default walking animation speed is 110ms/frame (like games running at
      the default 18fps) instead of 2 ticks/frame
    * "Previous attack" base ATK stat renamed to "Last damage by attacker"
    * Various general/battle/backcompat bitsets renamed or moved (see above)
    * "Caption" menu item type renamed to "Label", the "Unselectable" subtype
      of Labels renamed to "Disabled", and the "Close menu if selected" bit
      renamed to "Close menu when activated"
    * Sorting inventory "by whether usable" considers battle uses too [Ralph]
    * Shops auto-quit when there's nothing left to buy, as they used to [Ralph]
    * Sprite slices can no longer be resized in the slice editor (except by
      setting to Fill Parent -- not recommended) [Ralph]
    * Camera is now focused by default on hero walkabout container instead of
      sprite (see "Camera following a hero/NPC centers on" setting) to fix
      glitches when using camera script commands with large walkabouts [Ralph]
    * Can import .wav files as music
    * You can activate NPCs while holding down an arrow key [Ralph]
    * "free slice(0)" no longer shows a warning
    * unlump no longer asks for game password

  *** Bugfixes
    * Fix a major memory leak while recording .gifs [Ralph]
    * Couldn't copy-paste text containing characters above ASCII 127 [Ralph]
    * Panel slices set to clip had broken child clipping and positioning
      when inside another clipping slice or over the screen edge [Ralph]
    * In the textbox editor, pressing Ctrl+Left/Right to link to another box
      appeared to work but actually the "After" tag condition may not have
      gotten set to "Always", although it appeared it was. If you have any
      secretly-wrong textbox chains in your game you will be warned when you
      open it in Custom so you can fix them. (The in-game F1 textbox debug
      screen also showed "ALWAYS" instead of "NEVER"!) [Ralph]
    * Fixed "delete_ScriptData" error when quitting after having stopped
      a script in the script debugger [Ralph]
    * "hero z" could incorrectly throw "invalid party slot" errors, but
      its argument is actually party caterpillar rank [Ralph]
    * "hero is walking", "npc is walking" didn't consider pathfinding [James]
    * The width of a Text slice didn't update after changing the text in the
      slice editor [Ralph]
    * Bad results if "scroll to child" was called twice in a row, or after the
      slice tree was modified, without a "wait" in-between [Ralph]
    * Fixed exporting a blank BMP file instead of a tileset or backdrop
      when you browse to pick a different export location other than
      the default. [James]
    * Reimporting scripts by pressing F9 in the tileset editor would wipe
      the tileset [James]
    * Fix a crash that happened when you used ellipse-related scripting
      commands on a non-ellipse slice [sotrain515, James]
    * F4 to access the tag debugger in battles no longer worked [Ralph]
    * "rename hero" didn't return false if the player cancelled [Ralph]
    * If an Untargetable enemy was at exactly the same position as a
      targetable one it was possible to target it [Ralph]
    * "swap menu items" swapped the wrong items [Ralph]
    * "get NPC speed" always returned 0! [Ralph]
    * If you died with a textbox open and an on-death script cancelled the
      death, the textbox slice wasn't removed [Ralph]
    * In zone-editing mode the key to change indicator graphics was documented
      as G but was actually T. It's now actually G. And the keys to change
      selected zone were documented as +/- but are actually </>! Made some
      other improvements too [Ralph]
    * NPCs could walk through pushable NPCs being pushed against a wall. (Fix
      only enabled if "Simulate Pushable NPC obstruction bug" is off) [Ralph]
    * Bug sf#2037: "Attacker must know chained attack" didn't work correctly for
      known attacks in spell lists (it searched for attack ID+1) [Ralph]
    * Bug sf#2038: If the last enemy has the "Ignored for "Alone" AI" bit set,
      it doesn't count as alone [Ralph]
    * In turn-based mode, delaying an attack didn't always delay long enough.
      E.g. setting the delay to 1 attack could have no effect. [Ralph]
    * On Windows, if custom.exe crashed and you re-run, it might think the
      previous copy is still running and refuse to edit the game [Ralph]
    * "Don't chain if attack misses/fails" bit would skip Instead chains if
      the attacker's last attack missed/failed [Ralph]
    * In active-time battle mode, when a hero used an "Automatically choose
      target" attack or an enemy attacked, any queued turn-delayed attacks
      didn't have their delays count down [Chronas, Ralph]
    * The Experience Curve hero setting defaulted to 0.00 instead of 0.20 for
      pre-Beelzebufo games (specifically, any heroes which haven't been edited
      since then), resulting in very low XP needed to level [Ralph]
    * Hiding the HP stat would display garbage in Status menu instead. Also,
      it now hides the HP display/bar in battles too. [Ralph]
    * Test Game often didn't work when run on Mac OS 10.12+ (Sierra) [Ralph]
    * Crash when attack targetting mute/etc register used out-of-battle [Ralph]
    * "gain hero stat" could divide by zero and set a stat to 2147483647 [Ralph]
    * If stealing has 0% chance but isn't "Disabled", show "Has Nothing" message
    * Crash or freeze when switching between slice collections [Sword, Ralph]
    * Sometimes, the icon for game.exe didn't get replaced when Distributing
      Game for Windows [Ralph]
    * "Import tilemap, as new layers" crashed when importing 2+ layers [Ralph]
    * A few BAMs were cut off early when converted to MIDI, possibly right at
      the beginning, which could trigger a MIDI playback crash. Also fixed lost
      notes after loop points. [Ralph]
    * Crash when changing window zoom in certain editors/menus [Ralph]
    * Possible crash in script debugger [Sword, Ralph]
    * Bug gh#32: Lots of map editor problems when mixing one-way walls with
      undo or mark+clone tools [Ralph]
    * Bug gh#33: On Windows you can now import scripts even if HSpeak showed a
      warning. Been broken many years but no one thought to complain! [Ralph]
    * Changing hero or NPC speed while in the middle of a step, or using a
      speed value that doesn't divide into 20, no longer causes misalignment.
      Should have fixed that decades ago! Note, only speeds 3 and 7 are
      reasonable, other previously-forbidden ones cause jerky movement. [Ralph]
    * Bug gh#41: Corrupt tileset graphics and crash in Test Game after changing
      tilesets or reordering layers [Ralph]
    * Wrapping text slices with width < 8 are meant to wrap to the right edge
      of the screen but wrapped at wrong point [Ralph]

  *** Stuff Only Developers Will Notice
    * The .pt# 4-bit graphics lumps and .mxs backdrops lump have been replaced
      with a new RELOAD-based rgfx file format (old lumps are deleted) [Ralph]
    * Much more bug checking and display of previously silent errors

Dec 3 2017 [Etheldreme]

    * Enemy "appear" animations.
    * Customizable hero experience curve.
    * Textbox save/load/delete/end game conditionals.
    * Unhid still-experimental option for non-320x200 games.
    * Copy-paste text between the editor and other applications.
    * Visual browsers for sprites and many other things.
    * See below for more...

  * New Features
    * You can now browse for sprites, items, and many other properties
      rather than typing in their ID numbers. [James]
    * In the text box condition editor, you can browse for shops [James]
    * Menu bit "Remember selection when reopening" [Ralph]
    * Removed 100% upper limits on attack chain stat % conditions, and
      removed most hero/enemy stat limits
    * Rectangle slices can now optionally use any box border set.
      They are no longer limited to just the box borders defined in
      box styles [James]
    * Battle victory screens can optionally auto-advance after a given
      amount of time [James]
    * Slice editor/debugger improvements:
      * Organised the menu, irrelevant settings hidden
      * Indicate NPC and hero slices, and protected status
      * Press R to reset a slice's position to 0,0 and alignment/anchoring
        to top-left corner
      * Press F7 to hide the 'ants' outline around the selected slice
      [Ralph]
    * Ctrl+C/V to copy-and-paste text now uses the Mac/Windows/X11
      clipboard, so you can copy-paste from/to other applications [Ralph]
    * Customizable Experience Curve for each hero [MirceaKitsune]
    * You can choose tags that will be turned on when heroes are at
      specific levels [James]

    * Enemies can use optional "Appear" animations, which are reversed
      versions of the death fades. [James]
    * New textbox conditionals to save, load, or end the game, delete a
      save, or show the load/save menus [MirceaKitsune]
    * The option to use resolutions other than 320x200 (in the
      Window-size Options menu). This has been in testing for a long
      time, but still isn't complete -- for example backdrops and battles
      are still 320x200. Nothing has changed in this release except that
      the option isn't hidden any more [Ralph]
    * Three new ways to visualise map layers in the map editor:
      * Press Ctrl+Shift+arrows or Ctrl+right-click-drag to "skew" map
        layers (offset from each other)
      * Press T to tint each map layer a different color
      * Press T twice to grey out layers other than the selected one
      [Ralph]
    * Mouse support in the map editor! Not complete, but has the
      basics. You can't click on any of the overlays or bits of text (eg
      the list of zones) but you can click on toolbars and NPCs, doors,
      etc. Includes a new Stamp tool in wallmap mode. [Ralph]
    * Option to export a full resolution image of a map, optionally with
      NPCs [Ralph]
    * Map editor settings menu, accessed with F8. Most of the settings
      are new, including showing a grid [Ralph]
    * ID3 metadata info is preserved when imported MP3 files are converted
      to OGG [Ralph]
    * You can now (incrementally) search F1 help pages, just type! [Ralph]
    * New attack options:
      * Base attack stats:
        * 100 * number of targets
        * Lost MP (attacker)
        * Lost MP or HP (target)
      * Attack chain conditions:
        * All targets' X stat > attacker Y stat
        * All targets' X stat < attacker Y stat
        * Attacker X stat < attacker Y stat
        * Stat-based chance (attacker, max any target, min all targets)
      * Attack chain bitset "Invert condition"
      [zzo38, James]

  * New Plotscripting Features
    * "get rect raw border" and "set rect raw border" [James]
    * "clone slice" [Ralph]
    * "expand string" now has an optional argument that allows it to
      expand ${} codes based on the data in a save slot instead of the
      currently running game state [James]
    * "reset formation" and "reset formation slot" command to undo
      scripted modifications to battle formations. [James]
    * "set slice size" and "slice is map layer" [Ralph]
    * "NPCstat:tag1", "NPCstat:tag2" and "NPCstat:onetime use flag"
      constants for "read NPC"/"alter NPC" [Ralph]
    * "string sprintf" takes %b and %o codes for binary and octal [Ralph]
    * "check wall collision x/y" and "move slice with wallchecking" now
      allow sliding along walls instead of stopping on touching them:
      added a 'friction%' argument to each [Ralph]
    * Script reloading while live previewing now defaults to on; it no
      longer tries to reload unmodified scripts [Ralph]
    * "npc reference from slice", "hero rank from slice" [Ralph]
    * "slice type" [Ralph]
    * "first slice of type", "next sibling of type", and missing commands
      like "first text slice", "next text sibling", etc. [Ralph]
    * "assert(x==y)" now adds x and y values to the assert message [Ralph]
    * Global default Map autorun, On-keypress, Instead-of-battle, After-
      battle and Each-step script triggers [Ralph]

  * Changes
    * "greyscale palette" command now looks better; just averaging red,
      green and blue is perceptually very wrong [Ralph]

  * Bugfixes
    * Copy-paste in slice editor didn't copy slice extra data or autosort
      (also, couldn't edit the autosort sort order) [Ralph]
    * Windows only: Fixed a whole bunch of console windows popping up when
      entering Distribute Game menu, and elsewhere [Ralph]
    * "fill parent" and "set slice width/height" didn't work on Panel
      or Special slices [Ralph]
    * ${} codes in map names display correctly in the save/load screen
      [James]
    * A nonsensical item ownership number was showing up when hiring
      heroes at a shop [James]
    * Heroes killed by HP-cost in battle now correctly show their
      death frame instead of vanishing [James]
    * "add enemy to formation" was not putting enemies at the correct
      Y coordinate [James]
    * Fixed "check wall collision x/y" and "move slice with wallchecking"
      often failing to detect collision with corners of walls. Also,
      "move slice with wallchecking" now returns special values when it hit
      a corner rather than returing that it hit walls on two sides [Ralph]
    * Fix lots of g_debug.txt errors and long lags when using the Ctrl-F1
      teleport tool [Ralph]
    * Ancient .rpg files couldn't be played if they were renamed [Ralph]
    * Couldn't delete BAM files [Ralph]
    * Changing the zoom in Custom no longer changes window size [Ralph]
    * The height of awrapped text slice didn't update when its width
      changed (except in the slice editor) [Ralph]
    * The scroll bar of a scroll slice inside a clipping slice was drawn
      at the wrong position [Ralph]

  * Stuff Only Developers Will Notice
    * --nowait option when importing scripts from the commandline [Ralph]

September 22 2017 [Dwimmercrafty+1]

  * Bugfixes
     * Fixed a critical bug that erased On-Death-Bequest attacks and
       Non-Elemental-Counterattacks from all enemies when a game was
       loaded into custom. If you lost enemy data, and you still have
       a backup copy of your game from before August 29 2017, please
       ask the developers for help on the Forums. If you do not have
       a backup from before that date, you will have to re-add the
       missing On-Death-Bequest and Non-Elemental-Counter attacks
       to each enemy's attack list.
       We are very sorry about the bug!

August 31 2017 [Dwimmercrafty]

  Highlights:
    * NPC pathfinding, and other new NPC movetypes including follow-walls
    * Record .gif videos with Ctrl-F12
    * More map layers, hero definitions, and global variables
    * More info shown in-game in shops and spell lists
    * One-way walls
    * Lots of new in-game debug keys/F8 debug menu options, and a similar
      new menu in Custom accessed with F9
    * Can jump to attack, enemy, textbox and npc editors from other editors
    * Lots of progress on mouse support
    * On Windows, Custom's window is now resizable; resizing works almost
      everywhere
    * Sound effect volume control

  * New Features
    * Mark Non-elemental Elementals menu lets you define which elements
      shouldn't count as elemental for enemy spawning purposes [James]
    * Dramatic Pause for attack animations. Unlike "Delay Ticks" this
      always pauses time for everybody in battle. Dramatic pause starts
      after the (undelayed) caption appears, but before the visible
      animation begins [James]
    * New attacker animation "Standing Strike" [James]
    * Enemies can now do a non-elemental counterattack for any attack
      that lacks elemental damage. Similar to non-elemental spawning
      [James]
    * Spells in spell lists can now also display HP, Money, and Item
      costs. MP costs are no longer invisible in Level-MP spell lists
      [James]
    * If your max level is lower than 99, the hero stat editor now
      shows a middle column that displays stats at max level [James]
    * Per-textbox each-line sound effects, overriding the global option
      [MirceaKitsune]
    * 'Silence' as an option for textbox Music setting [MirceaKitsune]
    * Removed NPC definitions limit (NPC instance limit remains) [Ralph]
    * Added Redo (Ctrl+Y) to the sprite editor, and made the undo
      history size a few hundred times larger [Ralph]
    * Hold Shift in sprite and maptile editor to move faster, and use
      the number keys to change selected colour in sprite editor [Ralph]
    * Delete key in doorlinks menu deletes a doorlink [Ralph]
    * The hero battle menu editor now lets you change the text (caption)
      and color of an option, set tag conditions to disable it, and
      specify whether to hide it if disabled [Ralph]
    * Press Ctrl+F11 anywhere (in Game/Custom) to access a menu to
      record and replay macros (recorded keyboard input). You can use
      this to record game playthroughs, but it is still quite brittle
      for that purpose (many commands can cause desyncs) [James, Ralph]
    * Press Ctrl+F12 anywhere to start/stop recording a .gif video,
      saved next to the F12 screenshots. (You can use a .gif compressor
      program to considerably shrink the files.) [Ralph]
    * Map names can use the same ${} codes as textboxes, for example
      you could name a map "${H0}'s House". [James]
    * "Ignore Passmap" NPC setting, to walk through walls but not zones,
      the map edge, or NPCs/heroes. (Unlike "set npc ignores walls",
      which causes zones and map edge to be ignored.) [Ralph]
    * Added "Music Volume" and "Sound Volume" menu options. These
      replace the "Volume" option in the default main menu (which is
      the same as "Music Volume" except pressing Enter on it now opens
      another menu with Music and Sound Volume options). [Ralph]
    * Add "Initial music/sound effects volume" settings to the General
      Preference Menu. Relatedly, you can now also change the volume
      for Custom itself, see next... [Ralph]
    * A Global Editor Options menu accessible by pressing F9 anywhere
      in Custom, including options "Reimport Scripts", "Test Game",
      "Volume", "Zoom" and more [Ralph]
    * One-way walls. You can turn the walls on a tile into one-way walls
      by pressing W in the passmap editor. All the walls on a tile are
      either normal or one-way; you can't mix them on the same tile.
      Not supported with default passability yet. [Ralph]
    * Press +/- in wallmap mode to change the way walls are drawn [Ralph]
    * Press H in the slice collection editor to toggle whether the
      children of a slice are shown in the menu (does not affect slice
      visibility) [James]
    * New NPC movement types:
     * "Chase You (Pathfinding)" finds the shortest path to the hero,
       moving around obstacles, or else gets as close as possible [James]
     * "Chase You (Direct)" and "Avoid You (Direct)" which don't randomize
       and do nothing when stuck behind an obstacle. The old Chase/Avoid
       movement types are now captioned "(Meandering)" [James]
     * "Follow Walls (Right)" and "Follow Walls (Left)" as well as "Stops
       for others" variants of both. [James]
    * New or improved in-game debug keys (all available in F8 menu):
     * F1 text box debug info (only when a text box is displayed) [Ralph]
     * F4 tag debug mode sane controls and display improvements [Ralph]
     * Press F6 twice to display NPC debug info with additional NPC
       collision information [James]
     * Also, in F6 NPC debug mode you can view NPC info by mousing-over
       an NPC [Ralph]
     * Re-added F7 debug key to pan the camera (we used to have a similar
       debug key a while ago) [Ralph]
     * Added PAUSE debug key which works while walking around [Ralph]
     * Options to make the window resizable, or change the zoom [Ralph]
     * Ctrl-F8 (both Game and Custom) to switch graphics backends [Ralph]
    * General bitset "Don't stop music when starting/loading game" [Ralph]
    * Ability to reorder shop items/things in the editor [Ralph]
    * Preview of the surrounding tiles, or tiling of the current tile
      while drawing a maptile (click on the preview to toggle or hit P)
      [Matthias Meike]
    * You can now also remap the background color from the Import/Export
      Backdrop/Tileset menu; also added 'View with background' [Ralph]
    * Numbers can be typed with Numpad keys (I never even tried!) [Ralph]
    * Text editing: Ctrl-Backspace/Delete to delete the previous/next word
      (and for Mac, Option(aka Alt)-Delete/ForwardDelete, and move by word
      with Option-Left/Right).  The old Ctrl-Backspace key to delete all
      records after the current has changed to Shift-Backspace.  You can
      also press Delete on the <-- Record # --> line instead. [Ralph]
    * Raised the limit on hero definitions from 60 to 512 [Ralph]
    * Raised map layer limit from 8 to 16 [Ralph]
    * Added "Export scripts backup copy" option to Script Management menu
      (HSpeak has saved a backup copy of scripts for years now) [Ralph]
    * New preference bitset "Keep caterpillar length the same when speed
      changes" [James]
    * "Export to File" option in Script Usage and Find Broken Script
      Triggers menus [Ralph]
    * Added general preference bitset "Heroes use Walk in Place animation
      while idle" [James]
    * You can jump to the attack, enemy and textbox editors from anywhere
      you select an attack/enemy/box, or add a new one directly [Ralph]
    * In NPC placement mode you can open the NPC editor by pressing ENTER
      on tiles with NPCs (edit them) or without (edit current NPC) [Ralph]
    * Shops now display how many of an item you already own as well as
      how many you have equipped [James]
    * Metadata is shown for .ogg files in the music and sfx menus [Ralph]
    * Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V in the NPC definition editor copy/pastes NPCs [Ralph]
    * Most of Custom (except the map editor) now has at least partial
      mouse support. Also, experimental in-game mouse support (can be
      activated in the F8 debug menu) [James, Ralph]
    * (For now) made gfx_sdl the default backend for Custom on Windows, so
      that you can resize the window! Try it in the map or slice editors!
      Almost all editors can now run at higher resolutions [Ralph, James]
    * Image previewing when browsing for an image to import (only when
      the window is larger than 320x200) [Ralph]

  * New Plotscripting Features
    * "menu item at pixel" [Ralph, James]
    * You can now profile scripts (collect statistics on running times)
      by pressing Ctrl+F9. (Before, you had to download a special build
      to profile scripts.) More useful stats are now collected. [Ralph]
    * "run game" quits the current game and loads a different game
      (.rpg file/.rpgdir), and "check game exists" [Ralph]
    * You can now pass arguments to the newgame and loadgame scripts by
      giving extra arguments to "resetgame" and "loadfromslot" [Ralph]
    * "reparent to npc" and "reparent to hero" convenience functions
      [James]
    * Added "show new game" argument to "load menu" command [Ralph]
    * "get battle countdown" and "set battle countdown" [Ralph]
    * "check wall collision x", "check wall collision y",
      "move slice with wallchecking" [Ralph]
    * "slice parent" alias to "parent slice"
    * "get npc speed"
    * Added "textbox text" to read all lines from a textbox into a
      string variable at once [Matthias]
    * "load sprite" and "replace sprite" (general versions of "load
      hero sprite", etc) [Ralph]
    * Commands to check whether or not each of the suspend states is
      active, for example: "player is suspended", "npc walls are
      suspended", etc... [James]
    * NPC pathfinding commands: "pathfind npc to" "npc chases npc"
      "cancel npc walk" [James]
    * "get screen width" and "get screen height" [James]
    * "mouse release" to check if a click has just ended [James]
    * Commands for reading door information can now optionally read
      information about doors on other maps instead of the current map
      [James]
    * Changes to the language:
      * -= and += now return their result, like := does, so they can be
        used as expressions [Ralph]
      * subscript variables and arguments can now have the same name as
        variables in the parent script, "shadowing" them [Ralph]
      * Hexidecimal, octal and binary number constants, written like
        0xCABBA9E, 0o377 and 0b1101111000011 [Ralph]
    * Added "allow switching" argument to "equip menu" command [Ralph]
    * "gain hero stat", to easily increase/decrease a stat [Ralph]
    * "slice at pixel" and "find colliding slice" now respect clipping
    * Increased highest available global variable id number from
      16383 -> 50000 [James]
    * "set active battle pause for animations" [Ralph]

  * Changes
    * Sound effects used to play at max volume, which has now changed
      to a default of 80% (because music defaulted to just 50%). In
      newly created games the defaults are both 75%. [Ralph]
    * When importing a BMP, unless the palette is identical, color 0
      won't be used unless you explicitly pick it [Ralph]
    * Can input ID of unnamed lookup codes in slice editor [Ralph]
    * HSpeak now disallows most stray commas [Ralph]
    * Scripts triggered from a menu item now always get passed the menu
      item extra data, even if the first argument is the menu item
      handle [Ralph]
    * Custom's splash screen [Ralph]
    * Rearranged and renamed Custom's main menu items a bit; Edit Font is
      now under Edit Graphics [Ralph]

  * Bugfixes
    * 64-bit builds of Custom work now... for real this time! They
      would crash in several menus. 64 bit Linux builds now available.
      [James, Ralph, Matthias]
    * In old games, attacks with enemy type-killer bits wrongly counted
      as elemental for the purpose of spawning. This fix is only
      applied if the game has not been edited since Ypsiliform. [James]
    * The party leader will always draw on top of other heroes with the
      same Y position, and when heroes and NPCs are on the same layer,
      on top of NPCs that have the same Y position (instead of being
      layered unpredictably) This is most noticeable with vehicles that
      do not hide the leader. [Ralph, James]
    * "use item in slot" was not immediately updating item ownership
      tags [James]
    * Fix broken self-targeting on-death-bequest attacks [James]
    * gfx_directx: fixed incorrect positioning of the mouse cursor when
      the window was stretched or maximised, which caused problems with
      tile cursor movement in the tile browser and tile cutter [Ralph]
    * Bug 2006: gfx_directx: major slowdown after switching to another
      program while a joystick is plugged in [Ralph]
    * If you skipped the title instantly by pressing a key at the wrong
      moment then the load menu would have a blacked-out palette [Ralph]
    * Harm tiles didn't work if there are 'gaps' in the active party
      (caterpillar rank and party slots aren't equal) and caterpillar
      party was disabled [Ralph]
    * The Battle Formation Set menu miscalculated the number of steps
      until a battle occurs (it was too low). Also added average [Ralph]
    * music_native/native2: Changing the music volume only worked for
      MIDI, while everything else was played at max volume [Ralph]
    * Reload sound effects replaced while live-previewing. And
      reloading of UI colors & box styles had stopped working. [Ralph]
    * "write zone" was meant to return true on success, but didn't [Ralph]
    * "running on linux" returned true on Mac and BSD [Ralph]
    * Bug 2022: Can't run faster than 60fps under OSX [Ralph]
    * Script profiling "time/call" stats were wrong: now #calls only
      counts the number of calls while profiling enabled [Ralph]
    * gfx_directx: commandline args -f/--fullscreen, --width, --height
      and -z/--zoom now work [Ralph]
    * Fix a bug in turn-based battles that prevented cancelling backwards
      through hero action selection when there was a gap in the party
      [James]
    * Minimaps now display obsolete Overhead tiles correctly [Ralph]
    * If the Background UI color wasn't 0, ellipse slice border/fill color
      set to 0 didn't appear transparent [Ralph]
    * Textbox line sounds weren't played for the first two lines [Ralph]
    * SDL_mixer.dll (Windows only) recompiled to use modplug instead of
      mikmod to play modules. This fixes bad sound quality, broken
      looping, some files not playing, and too-low volume [Ralph]
    * If you used Zenzizenzic (2011) or later to open a game last edited
      with Ubersetzung (2007) or earlier, all your enemy "is <enemytype>"
      and "weak to/strong to/absorbs" element bits bits were discarded
      instead of being upgraded to "takes X% damage from ..." settings.
      The upgrade routine has been fixed, but your data is gone. If you
      still have an old copy of your game, ask for help. [Ralph]

  * Stuff Only Developers Will Notice
    * Support latest FreeBASIC version, by adding OPENFILE layer [Ralph]
    * Cross-compiling support using "scons target=..." [Ralph]
    * After 12 years of cleanup, the source is now free of GOSUBs!
      [James, Mike, Ralph, Matthias]
    * FreeBSD support [Ralph]

June 06 2016 [Callipygous+1]

  * New Features
    * If you are using the gfx_sdl backend, almost all menus in
      custom can make use of the extra space when the window is
      maximized

  * Bugfixes
    * You weren't meant to be able to resize the window in the sprite
      editor; doing so would corrupt graphics (gfx_sdl only) [Ralph]
    * Under Unix, utilities couldn't be run (e.g. to encode and import
      audio or distribute the game) on files containing the characters
      ( ) | < > # ; &.
    * Running utilities (like hspeak) didn't work on Macs where the
      OHRRPGCE hadn't been installed previously [Ralph]
    * Delete key didn't work while typing on Macs. And after resizing
      the window, text input stopped working. [Ralph]
    * Fix the Android virtual gamepad being hidden if you open a game,
      exit to the file-picker and then open a game again
    * Options for changing the window size now work on Macs [Ralph]
    * "unhide mouse cursor" now works in fullscreen too [Ralph]

  * Stuff Only Developers Will Notice
    * 64 bit builds work now.

April 04 2016 [Callipygous]

  * New Features
    * Ported to Android phones and tablets, as well as specific support
      for the OUYA, Gamestick and FireTV Android-based consoles!
      New "Platform-specific options" menu in General Game Data.
      See http://rpg.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Making_Android_games
      for information about how to port your game. You can't yet use
      the Distribute Game menu for Android. [James, Ralph]
    * While placing doors in the map editor you can now specify door
      number, and jump to existing door locations [Ralph]
    * When buying equipment in a shop, show stat bonuses [James]
    * When hiring heroes in a shop, show hero portraits [James]
    * Split "Change Box Styles", "Change User-Interface Colors" into
      two separate menus [James]
    * Split "General Preference Bitsets" and "Backwards-compatibility
      Bitsets" into two menus [Ralph]
    * Clean up orphaned temporary folders when you exit game [James]
    * Games can now optionally increase (or decrease) the number of
      save/load slots that are available. [James]
    * In the font editor you can set roughly which characters are
      icons. If you use a font with the extra Latin-1 characters
      (eg. with accents), then those letters will now show correctly in
      the .txt file when exporting textboxes.  And characters which are
      icons won't be exported as garbage in .hsi files. [Ralph]
    * Attack chains conditions can now be based on the stats of the
      targets [James]
    * Attack bitset "Never trigger elemental counterattack" [James]
    * The map editor's Clone tool now has separate 'merge' and 'replace'
      modes (Ctrl+M to toggle) [Ralph]
    * When adding a new map layer you may copy an existing one [Ralph]
    * When importing an 8-bit backdrop or tileset (eg. exported from
      another game) color 0 (transparency) is preserved; when importing
      a 24/32-bit one you now have the option to pick the background
      color [Ralph]
    * Ability to specify the positions of the frames in the source
      spritesheet when importing with the sprite editor in full-set
      mode (regular offsets between frames only) [Ralph]
    * Additional master palettes in import/ [Soda_piggy, Dragontao]
    * Added Saved Game Settings menu, with new options to enable saving
      and restoring of:
      * the spritelayer slice (default parent for new slices). Slice
        handles to these slices remain valid after loading.
      * strings (including display settings)
      [Ralph]
    * Most 32 bit BMPs should be importable now [Ralph]
    * Attack damage bitset "Healing poison causes regen, and reverse";
      useful when attacker or target absorbs damage [Ralph]
    * Press F8 in-game to access the Debug Menu; works in battles too.
      It's the only debug key you'll ever need to remember! Includes
      new debug options including:
      * Test Battles, to fight any formation
      * Edit backcompat bitsets
      * Email saved game (Android only)
      * Toggle debug/reload mode
      Also, a few debug keys changed or were removed.
      [Ralph, James]
    * Added F7 debug key to kill all targettable enemies. Also, the tag
      debugger is available in-battle with F4; instant-run moved to
      Ctrl+F4. [Ralph, James]
    * Added Shift+Tab debug key to speed up the game while held down
      (an alternative to Ctrl+Plus/Minus debug keys) [Ralph]
    * New formation options: Victory tag to set a tag according to
      whether the battle was won, and an option to prevent game over
      on death. [MirceaKitsune, Ralph]
    * The textbox editor now wraps text as you type [Ralph]
    * Automatically keep a few backup copies of any rpg file you edit
      This is no substitute for manual backups! Do not forget to
      back up your own work! [James]
    * Menu for basic importing and exporting of tilemap data from/to
      .tilemap and .bmp files (the .bmps are minimaps). [Ralph]
      To export images of maps, use RMSephy's tool instead:
      https://github.com/Spencer-Zhang/ohr-cartographer
    * Option to adjust the framerate. This isn't really a finished
      feature, as increasing the framerate leads to crazy walking
      animations.  You probably shouldn't change the framerate in an
      existing game, as it will break all your wait() lengths and hero,
      npc, camera, etc. movement speeds. [Ralph]
    * Global sound effect options for steal attack success, failure,
      and no item to steal. [Ralph]
    * Added Regen icon to Battle System Options. [Ralph]
    * Hero positions in battle can be customized. [James]
    * Enemies can now be placed anywhere onscreen in formations [Ralph]
    * Starting hero ID can be customized, and you can also set a
      'starting' textbox to display on a new game. [Ralph]
    * Added "Old attack positioning at bottom-left of target" back-
      compat bitset, which if you turn off places attack sprites at
      the center of the target instead. [Ralph]
    * You can now run multiple copies of Custom at once (but can't
      open the same .rpg more than once). [Ralph]
    * You can now use the mouse to select or highlight slices in the
      slice editor, press F5 to edit the hidden root slice, F6 to shift
      around the view, and V to toggle slice visibility. [Ralph]
    * New .rpg files start with a few template walkabout sets, donated
      by FnrrfYgmSchnish
    * Added options to set how large the game's window should be by
      default (by changing the scaling factor). The default size will
      for most people be larger than the old 2x default.
      Also added a setting to make the game run in fullscreen by
      default, unless the player has a remembered preference. [Ralph]
    * "Windowed" and "Fullscreen" special menu items. They appear in
      the default menu in new games; other games need updating. [Ralph]
    * The Distribute Game options will make use of Mac or Windows icons
      if it finds the icon files next to your .rpg file. See
      http://rpg.hamsterrepublic.com/ohrrpgce/Icons for details [James]

  * Changes
    * Hidden menu items no longer affect the width of a menu [Ralph]
    * A new Debug/Release mode setting replaces the old script
      errorlevel. All existing games default to Release mode. Release
      mode hides almost all script errors and warnings; Debug mode
      should be used for testing but not for release. [James]

  * Bugfixes
    * Fixed a few cosmetic bugs in the equip menu including possibly
      wrong resultant stat value being shown [Ralph]
    * Hero stats menu would freeze if Maximum Level was zero [Ralph]
    * You can now change the music with a script immediately after a
      map change without the ambient music playing for a moment [Ralph]
    * Bug 857: Focus camera cannot focus on spots close to map edge
      [James]
    * Fix heroes getting stuck in active-time battle mode if they are
      in the middle of targetting an attack and get hit with a stun
      or mute attack. [James]
    * "showtextbox happens immediately" backcompat bitset (on for new
      games) helps to prevent bugs due to showing two boxes at once;
      "show textbox" now affects "current textbox" immediately [Ralph]
    * HSpeak accepts files with Mac line-endings again [Ralph]
    * Fix attacks that use the attacker's max stats as the base attack
      stat [James]
    * Fix vehicles that are configured to disable random battles [James]
    * Bug 997: Crash/freeze when fullscreening in Mac OS 10.7 and later
    * Bug 777: 'Load' menu called from a customisable menu showed a
      'New Game' button which did nothing [Ralph]
    * Disabling palette colours for backdrop/tileset import didn't work
      for 8-bit BMPs. (Also added mouse support.) [Ralph]
    * Bug 1004: Copying a shop didn't copy all the shop items [Ralph]
    * Hero attack animations didn't occur if they were weak [Ralph]
    * Bug 1005: "hero is walking" didn't work for heroes other than
      leader when the caterpillar party was enabled [Ralph]
    * Bug 763: NPCs and heros flickered when you walked over the edge
      of a wrapping map [Ralph]
    * Multi-hit attacks no longer causing dying enemies to dissolve/
      fade multiple times, and additional hits are cancelled once all
      targets have died [Ralph]
    * On-keypress scripts are now always triggered when mouse buttons,
      or keys other than move, use and cancel, are held down [Ralph]
    * Fix general map data corruption that occured when loading certain
      very old games released before July 8 1999 [James]
    * Fix a few problems when installed in a read-only location [Ralph]
    * Bug 2013: Pre-Beelzebufo games expected backdrops to appear
      above the sprite layer [Ralph]

  * New Plotscripting Stuff
    * "Menu action plotscript" special script trigger to run a script
      instead of opening the main menu [Lakan Inocencio]
    * subscripts: scripts embeddable inside other scripts, with access
      to their local variables [Ralph]
    * "read item description" counterpart to existing "read item name"
      [James]
    * "get sprite default pal" [James]
    * "NPC is disabled" for detecting when an NPC reference is disabled
      by tags or by one-time-use [James]
    * "string sprintf" for easier piecing together of strings [Ralph]
    * "script error", "get calling script id", "get script name",
      "dump slice tree" [Ralph]
    * Make $id="foo" return id so that you can write showstring($1="foo")
    * Press F5 in Custom's main menu or Script Management menu to
      reimport the last imported scripts. And while testing a game
      you can now set the scripts to be reloaded automatically (from the
      data reload menu, press F5 in-game to access it) [Ralph]
    * "camera follows slice" [Ralph]
    * "get/set/reset hero picture/palette" family of commands can now
      also manipulate hero portrait pictures [James]
    * "get level mp" now takes an additional argument, "current stat"
      or "maximum stat" [Ralph]
    * plotscr.hsd, scancodes.hsi and your game's .hsi file are now all
      included automatically, so there's no need to put those "include"
      lines at the top of your scripts file [Ralph]
    * "get/set active battle pause on all menus" [James]
    * "dissolve sprite", "cancel dissolve", "sprite is dissolving",
      "wait for dissolve" [James]
    * "running on desktop", "running on mobile", "running on console",
      "running on windows", "running on mac", "running on linux"
    * "show virtual gamepad", "hide virtual gamepad",
      "auto virtual gamepad" [James]
    * "get horiz align", "get vert align", "get horiz anchor",
      "get vert anchor" [James]
    * "create select" "slice is select" "set slice select index"
      "get slice select index" "slice child index" [James]
    * "create scroll" "slice is scroll" "set scroll bar style"
      "get scroll bar style" "set scroll check depth"
      "get scroll check depth" "scroll to child" [James]
    * "create panel", "slice is panel", "get panel is vertical",
      "set panel is vertical", "get panel primary index",
      "set panel primary index", "get panel percent as int",
      "set panel percent", "get panel pixels", "set panel pixels",
      "get panel padding", "set panel padding" [James]
    * "next npc reference" [Ralph]
    * "input string with virtual keyboard",
      "input string with mouse keyboard" [James]
    * "unhide mouse cursor", "hide mouse cursor" [James]
    * "pixel focus camera" [James]
    * Added 'visible only' argument to "slice at pixel" and
      "find colliding slice" [Ralph]
    * "send email" (Android only), "debug menu" [Ralph]

  * Performance Fixes
    * Fixed delay when opening a menu that happened when a large number
      of menus were defined [Ralph]
    * HSpeak was extremely slow (potentially hours) at reading files
      with DOS/Windows line-endings on Linux/Mac [Ralph]
    * The script interpreter was running tight loops much (eg 2x) slower
      than it used to before Beelzebufo [Ralph]
    * Creating or reparenting thousands of slices was slow [Ralph]

  * Stuff Only Developers Will Notice
    * Experimental support for ARM and other non-x86 devices, such as
      the Raspberry Pi, and for native 64-bit builds. All thanks to the
      FreeBASIC developers! [Ralph]

April 9 2013 [Beelzebufo]

  * New Features
    * General preference bitset "Don't reset max stats after OOB attack"
      to prevent stat maximum values from being altered by attacks and
      items outside of battle [Ralph]
    * Max tag is now 15999 instead of 999 [James]
    * Max NPC onetime tag is now 15999 instead of 1000 [James]
    * A bunch of attack bitsets have moved into the Attack Damage
      Settings Menu, which now dynamically hides settings and bitsets
      that have no effect, and shows in detail how the attack damage
      will actually be calculated. [Ralph]
    * When adding a new hero, attack, enemy or shop, added the option
      to copy an existing one [Ralph]
    * Attack can optionally override the hero's weapon sprite [James]
    * Enemies can do an On-Death Bequest attack when killed [James]
    * Textbox backdrops can optionally allow color 0 to be transparent
      [Ralph, James]
    * The battle system can now be switched into Turn-based mode [James]
    * Attacks can be given a turn-delay in addition to a tick delay
      [James]
    * Attack base stat is no longer limited to the attacker's current
      stat. Now it can also be attacker's max stat, targets current
      stat, or target's max stat [James]
    * Press Enter or Space on "Base ATK Stat" to browse a menu of all
      available base attack stats [James]
    * Revamped the hero spell list editor to make it easier to use
      [James]
    * Menu editor now allows you to adjust the line-spacing [James]
    * Menu editor allows the selected item to be highlighted with
      the highlight background color in addition to flickering the text
      [James]
    * Hero battle menus are now customizable. You can remove weapon
      attack and the items menu, add specific attacks, add more than 6
      menu items, and reorder battle menu items [James]
    * Stats can be hidden for a hero. This prevents them from appearing
      on the Status and Equip menus. [James]
    * Map layers can now be named [Ralph]
    * You can set the maximum size of a stack of items in the inventory
      with per-item and default settings [Ralph]
    * Goodbye 4-bit BMPs! You can now import sprites, backdrops and
      tilesets from BMP files saved at (almost) any bitdepth (but
      sprites are still limited to 16 colors), and most common versions
      of the BMP file format are now supported. Greatly improved the
      sprite importer's handling of palettes and previewing. [Ralph]
    * Map editor improvements:
      * Mark and Clone (copy/paste) tools. They simultaneously copy all
        visible map layers, walls, foemap and zones.
      * Changes to key bindings so that you no longer need to press
        Ctrl to switch the tool. A and B vehicle bits are now Ctrl+A/B.
      * In wallmap mode you can now use the Box and Paint tools to
        set any wall directions/bits
      * You can select a block of tiles on the tileset to draw with
      [Ralph]

  * Bugfixes
    * Fix the arrow key problem in Custom on Mac OS X for the third
      time (this time for real!) [Ralph]
    * Mac OS 10.4 and 10.5 are now supported again [Ralph]
    * "run script by id" was far slower than it should have been [Ralph]
    * ${H#} codes in text boxes are no longer limited to heroes that
      are in the party.
    * Bug 968: "Reset target stat to max before hit" attack bit takes
      effect even if the attack fails due to elemental resistance or
      "Show damage without inflicting" is set [Ralph]
    * Fix inns called directly from textboxes with no shop, which were
      restoring the party even if you refused to pay [James]
    * zone at spot(X, Y, getcount) returned 1 less than the actual count
    * Bug 973: Strange behaviour when closing one game and playing
      another without quitting Game [Ralph]

    * Shops no longer allow you to buy items if you don't have room for
      them in your inventory [James]

      items or "map cure") a game over wasn't triggered [Ralph]

  * New Plotscripting Stuff
    * If a script runs for a long time without "wait"ing you can now
      interrupt it by pressing any key. [Ralph]
    * New commands "set onetime" and "check onetime" that work similarly
      to "set tag" and "check tag" [James]

      typing more than just the first letter of the scripts name [James]
    * "delete npc" as an alias to "destroy npc"
    * HamsterSpeak syntax changes:
      * "include" syntax is more lenient, like it used to be. Quotes
        around filenames containing paths, upper case or spaces optional
      * The characters '{', '}', '[', ']', '.' are now totally disallowed
      * < and > can be used instead of << and >>
      * "do" after a case is optional, and you may write case(else) ...
        instead of else(...). Example:
            switch (dir) do (
              case (north, south) return (1)
              case (else)         return (0)
            )
      * "else if" is a shortcut which lets you omit a pair of brackets:
            if (condition) then (...)
            else if (condition 2) then (...)
            else (...)
      [Ralph]

    * "hero Z", "NPC Z", "set NPC Z" [Ralph]
    * "set hero stat cap" [Ralph]
    * "wait for sound"
    * Each of a hero's stats now has a base value in addition to
      current and maximum values. See "base stat" in the Plotscripting
      Dictionary for information. [Ralph]
    * "get item maximum stack size" [Ralph]
    * "door at spot", "suspend doors", "resume doors" [Ralph]

Jun 15 2012 [Alectormancy]

  * New Features
    * Adjustable global HP thresholds for hero and enemy Weak states
      (hero graphics and enemy desperation attacks) [Adam Perry]
    * New in-game debug key: CTRL+F4 to view/edit/export the slice
      tree with the slice collection editor [Ralph]
    * A general game option to change how the inventory Autosort
      option works [Ralph]
    * Master Palettes menu: added export option [Ralph]
    * Play-as-you-edit, AKA live previewing of games, with a new
      "Test Game" option in Custom. Still unfinished! [Ralph]
      * New debug key: press F5 in-game to access a menu where you can
        reload various game data. Most useful when live-previewing a
        game. The old F5 and Ctrl+F5 debug keys (free camera movement)
        have been changed to F7 and Ctrl+F7. [Ralph]
      * Ctrl+S in the map and tileset editors immediately saves.
        (Moved old Ctrl+S (paint the screen) to Ctrl+W (ie. paint the
        "window")) [Ralph]
    * New general bitset "Attacks will ignore extra hits stat" [James]
    * NPCs can now be assigned avoidance (wall) zones as well as
      movement zones. The avoidance zones have precedence. [Ralph]
    * Default NPC movement and avoidance zones can be set in the
      General Map Data menu [Ralph]
    * Distribute Game menu, where you can automatically package your
      game to distribute to other people. [James]
      * Distribute as Zip file
      * Distribute as Windows installer
      * Distribute as Debian Linux package
    * Script trigger log: press CTRL+F10 in-game to cause triggered
      scripts (not called from other scripts) to be logged to
      script_log.txt. It might help to restart/reload the game
      after enabling it if running scripts are missing. [Ralph]
    * Formation sets can now be disabled by tag conditions [Ralph]
    * Partial Unicode support, currently limited to the Latin-1
      character set:
      * A new default font which includes the Latin-1 characters
      * Your operating system's native keyboard layout/text inputting
        methods are used when entering text, both in Game and Custom.
        The input is restricted to Latin-1, though of course you'll
        need the characters in your font to see them.
        (Does not work with the gfx_fb backend).
      * Support for non-ASCII filename encodings while browsing
      * HSpeak has better, full Unicode support. It automatically
        recognises the encoding as ASCII/Latin-1, UTF-8, or UTF-16.
        Script names and strings are dumbed down to Latin-1 on import.
      [Ralph]
    * New general bitset "Don't divide experience between heroes" [James]

      battles [Ralph]
    * In the map editor, tile 0 on map layers did not correctly become
      transparent after swapping map layers [Ralph]
    * Fixed a whole lot of things which failed to immediately update
      tags they were meant to (eg. the "unequip" and "items menu"
      commands). Also tag changes didn't immediately update disabled
      menu items and often didn't update disabled NPCs [Ralph]
    * Menus didn't resize or scroll properly/immediately after items
      were added/removed/enabled/disabled/selected, and similarly
      the "set menu max rows" command was broken [Ralph]
    * You can now type negative numbers more naturally. No need to
      type a positive number and toggle it negative [James]
    * NPC definitions weren't being saved by "save map state" and
      the "Remember NPC data" option, and "delete map state" didn't
      work on NPC locations/instances [Ralph]
    * 'Set target stat to %' attacks were being affected by the damage
      cap [Ralph]
    * Harm tile mess:
      * Harm tiles didn't affect non-visible heroes when the
        caterpillar party was disabled (fix enabled only with "Harm
        tiles harm non-caterpillar party" general preference bitset)
      * Didn't trigger when crossing over them using walkhero with
        distance more than 1 [Ralph]
    * "export globals" was broken in strange ways [Ralph]
    * "input string" would hide string 0 instead of the one it was
      meant to; also changed the way the 'center' and position
      arguments behave to make more sense [Ralph]
    * Bug 942: Attacks didn't chain if they depended on a tag with
      ID >= 128 [San]
    * It was no longer possible to import BAM files [Ralph]
    * In-battle music option 'silence' acted the same as 'same as
      last map'. Broken since xocolatl! [Ralph]
    * When "camera follows NPC" was used the camera lagged one tick
      behind the NPC [Ralph]
    * The pause key didn't pause battles anymore [Ralph]
    * Bug 945: Attacks used from a hero's spell list out-of-battle
      used the average party stats instead of that hero's [Ralph]
    * Fix ${C#} codes in textboxes which have been (embarrasingly)
      broken for as long as the feature has existed [James]
    * Bug 956: gfx_directx: graphics could be mangled at startup
      until the window is resized [Jay]

  * New Plotscripting Stuff
    * You can now have global variables up to 16383 instead of 4095
      [James]
    * Slice velocity commands to make a slice move automatically at
      pixels-per-tick speeds. [James]
    * Slice movement commands to make a command move to a target
      position over a desired number of ticks. [James, Ralph]
    * "wait for slice" command to make the script wait for slice
      movement [James]
    * New "Ellipse" slice type, and related commands [James, Ralph]
    * "NPCstat: default movement zone" constant for "read/alter npc"
    * "assert" [Ralph]
    * "menu item true slot", "menu item by true slot" [Ralph]
    * "get hero slice" and "get NPC slice" commands [James]
    * "get door x", "get door y", "get door destination id",
      "get door destination map", "door exists" [Mogri]
    * "get attack caption" [Mogri]
    * "get rect fuzziness", "set rect fuzziness" [Ralph]
    * "textbox line" replaces "string from textbox", fixing the
      broken 'expand' argument and adding 'strip' argument [Ralph]
    * "get slice text" [Ralph]
    * "get input text" (and "enable input text") which obsoletes
      "last ascii" [Ralph]
    * "get hero hand x", "get hero hand y", "set hero hand x",
      "set hero hand y", "get default hero hand x",
      "get default hero hand y" [James]
    * Increased number of strings to 100 (0 to 99) [Ralph]

  * Stuff Only Developers Will Notice
    * Certain special engine-related Slices are marked as protected
      to indicate that plotscripts are not permitted to delete or
      reparent them.
    * New comand-line options:
      -autosnap N         Automatically save a screen snapshot every N ticks
      -runfast            Run quickly (without speed control)
      -autotest           Run quickly and write screenshots on _checkpoints

    * New general bitset "Locked heroes can't be re-ordered" [James]
    * Slice collection editor can create complex collections of slices
      to load into plotscripts [James]
    * New general bitset, "Attack captions pause battle meters" [James]
    * Savegames are now in a new format. Instead of a gamename.sav
      file you will have a gamename.saves folder. (the conversion is
      automagical and you will not lose any saves) [James]
    * Rewrote script usage menu to be enormously faster and sort
      scripts into numerical/alphabetical order [Ralph]
    * You may now have up to 500 NPC definitions per map [Ralph]
    * Maximum map size raised to 100,000 tiles [Ralph]
    * New menu item bitset to suppress the on-load script if the
      menu item closes the menu [James]
    * New menu feature to automatically open another menu when you
      close the current menu with ESC [James]
    * Expanded (and fixed) Erase Map Data menu [Ralph]
    * The line and oval tools are now pleasant to use instead of
      teeth-gnashingly awful, and the pixels in the tile editor are
      no longer stretched [Ralph]
    * Added Replace Colour tool to tile and sprite editors [Ralph]
    * New general bitset "Don't randomize battle ready meters" [James]
    * New attack bitset "Delay doesn't block further actions" allows
      attacks to be queued without blocking the attacker from taking
      other actions [James]
    * Jay Tennant's gfx_directx is now the default graphics backend
      under Windows (automatic fallback to gfx_sdl on old computers).
      Click the window icon to access gfx_directx's Options menu, and
      drag the corner of the window to change zoom!
    * gfx_directx input rewrite: adds joystick support, normal mouse
      speed/acceleration, removes forced mouse clipping and adds
      "mouse region" support [Jay]
    * gfx_directx expanded hardware support [Jay]
    * gfx_directx added option in Options dialog to disable system
      messages (like Alt-Space) from operating--Alt-Tab and Alt-Enter
      still function as expected [Jay]
    * When using an item in the item menu, there is now visual feedback
      when you use the last item in a stack. [James]
    * Lots of new scancodes added for scripts: you can now, for example,
      tell apart Numpad 2 and the Down key. You have to turn on the
      general bitset "Enable better scancodes" for these to fully work,
      see "key is pressed" in the dictionary for more details. [Ralph]
    * New dissolve animations Squeeze, Shrink and Flicker [Ralph]
    * Page up/page down/home/end keys now work in most built-in
      in-game menus [Ralph]
    * You can set a cap on the maximum hero level, from 0 to 99 [Ralph]
    * (Anti-feature) The internal password format has changed a 3rd
      time. Old utilities and versions of Custom will not be able to
      open passworded games; remove the password to use them. [Ralph]
    * Lots of element related stuff:
      * Enemy, hero, and equipment elemental strong/weak/absorb bits
        have been replaced with percentage-based "Damage from <element>"
        options. The second Status menu screen now shows percentages.
      * Attack "Fail vs. <element> resistance" bits have been replaced
        with percentage-based elemental resistance failure thresholds.
      * The enemy types have been replaced by elements 9-16: "Is
        <enemytype>", "Bonus to <enemytype>" and "Fail vs. <enemytype>"
        have been translated to elemental equivalents.
      * In Battle System Options you can select from three formulae
        for combining equipment elemental resistances into the
        effective elemental resistances for heroes.
      * You can now have up to 64 elements (you have to set a
        higher number of elements before they become available).
      [Ralph]
    * You can select menu items on Custom's main menu and graphics menu
      by hotkey (eg. I for Edit Items or Import Music) [Ralph]
    * Ctrl+F8 debug to print out the slice tree to g_debug.txt
    * Added Zones to maps. A zone is just a group of tiles on the map,
      with data attached (sadly no triggers are implemented yet). There
      are 9999 zones per map. Each NPC type may have a 'movement zone',
      confining where it can move. [Ralph]
    * Added drawing tools -- Draw, Box, Fill, Replace, and Paint
      Tilemap -- to the map editor, available in Tile, Wall, Foe, and
      Zone modes! [Ralph]
    * Press Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+Y to Undo and Redo changes in the tilemap,
      wallmap, foemap, and zonemap editors! These share a single
      near-infinite history. Certain operations delete the history.
      [Ralph]
    * Attack maximum Extra Damage raised to 32767%
    * You can customise the amount of experience given to heroes not
      in the active party in the Battle System Options menu [Ralph]
    * Import .hss files in Custom, and they will be automatically
      compiled with hspeak [Ralph]
    * You can now define enemy counterattacks against elemental
      and stat-damaging attacks! Does not use the CTR stat. [James]

  * Bugfixes
    * Bug 749: Attacks configured to do No Damage still do damage when
      used outside battle [James]
    * Bug 819: %-based attacks don't heal outside of battle [James]
    * Bug 9: Elemental strength/weakness/absorbtion is not yet applied
      to spells used outside of battle. [James]
    * Fixed a case where "add hero" could add more heroes than you
      are supposed to be able to have under certain conditions [James]
    * Bug 486: Chained attacks fail on stored dead targets
      [James, msw188]
    * Bug 851: Instead-chains fail or cause other chains to fail under
      certain conditions [James msw188]
    * Using an item that triggers a text box could cause a menu
      double-close warning if the menu item that opened the items menu
      was set to always close the menu [James]
    * Bug 845: upgrading old games that contain no shop stuff lump
      always produced a confusing warning [James]
    * 'Set tag', 'Toggle tag' and 'Close menu' options were ignored
      when menu items were triggered via "use menu item" [Ralph]
    * NPCs appearance was not updated according to tags set from a
      menu item or from the tag debug menu [Ralph]
    * "create NPC" could create NPCs with garbage 'extra data' [Ralph]
    * gfx_directx: fixed garbage and window resizing at startup [Jay]

    * gfx_directx: fixed graphical errors in Vista/Win7 [Jay]
    * gfx_directx: fixed Ctrl-Alt-Del crashes in Vista/Win7 [Jay]
    * gfx_directx: fixed slow downs caused by leaving the window [Jay]
    * gfx_directx: fixed window resizing/engine cursor issues [Jay]
    * gfx_directx: fixed garbage occurring when enabling/disabling
      Aspect Ratio Preservation in Options dialog [Jay]
    * Your MP (and the rest of the spell menu) is no longer hidden
      while you target a spell outside of battle. [James]
    * Scrolling a sprite or a maptile is now done with the new scroll
      tool instead of holding down the CAPSLOCK key, which was rather
      annoying. You can now click and drag to scroll. [Ralph]
    * Getting the maptile under the cursor is now done with the G key
      (instead of the CAPSLOCK key, which we can all agree was
      confusing!) [James]
    * "string to globals" and "globals to string" weren't working
      with global variable IDs > 1024 [Ralph]
    * Bug 863: "load tileset" and "change tileset" did not
      (completely) work on map layers 3 and above [Ralph]
    * music_sdl no longer secretly keeps seperate volume levels for
      MIDIs and non-MIDIs, which confused people and broke fading
      scripts. [Ralph]
    * Cursor, accept and cancel sound effects weren't used in battles
      [Ralph]
    * Could not exit from empty menus with Esc key [Ralph]
    * Fixes to fatal error reporting: no longer gives the option to
      continue if it means corrupting the game, and Custom no longer
      deletes working.tmp, so that you can recover your work [Ralph]
    * "horiz flip sprite" and "vert flip sprite" reset the sprite's
      palette to default [Ralph]
    * Trying to reorder map layers if there's only one crashed [Ralph]
    * Bug 865: Slices attached to map layer 0 were drawn on top of all
      map layers [Ralph]
    * Fixed an assortment of 19 bugs in HSpeak: crashes, missing error
      checking, miscompiling and misoptimising scripts, incorrect
      error messages [Ralph]
    * Bug 827: Flood fill in the sprite editors could count all pixels
      of one colour around the sprite edges as connected [Ralph]

    * "set npc ignores walls", "get npc ignores walls",
      "set npc obstructs", "get npc obstructs", "set npc usable",

    * selectmenuitem and nextmenuitem did not work, unselected menus
      didn't become inactive when the topmost menu was changed by script,

      the order of menu items created by scripts changed in various
      circumstances [Ralph]

  * New Features
    * Input string gets 3 new arguments, center, positionx, positiony.
      It also behaves a little different now. [Yuriy]
    * Hspeak.exe now waits for a keypress when finished, which should avoid

      massive weirdness" - "keyispressed" command has been changed so that it

      [Ralph Versteegen]

    * In the plotscripting dictionary, NPCcount was described as

    * c and v no longer appended to a string when copying and pasting
      [Ralph Versteegen]

      And bug 66: "Absorb-damage type attacks cannot drain a percent"
      [Mike Caron]

      after quitting" [Mike Caron]

    * Fixed bug 136: "Use of quotes in BAM import list causes weirdness"
      by scrapping .SNG storage scheme [Ralph Versteegen]

  * New Plotscripting Commands

    * "cancel map name display" [James Paige]
    * "suspend map music", "resume map music" [Ralph Versteegen]
    * "seconds of play", "set days of play", "set hours of play",
      "set minutes of play", "set seconds of play" [Mike Caron]
    * "read NPC" (counterpart of alter NPC) [James Paige]
    * "set hero level", "give experience", "hero levelled",
      "spells learnt" [Ralph Versteegen]
    * "get damage cap", "set damage cap" [Mike Caron]
    * "get music volume", "set music volume" [Ralph Versteegen]
    * "trace" [Mike Caron]
    * "get song name" [Ralph Versteegen]

  * Stuff only Developers Will Notice

    * More attack bitsets [Mike Caron]
    * Unified item-name editor data (all item slots are formatted the
      same now) [Mike Caron]
    * New MIDI driver [Mike Caron]
    * Native Linux port mostly working (games are playable and editable,
      Browsing still has some problems, espeically in music importing,
      and full-screen causes problems) [Simon Bradley, James Paige]
    * .SNG lump replaced with binary expandable songdata.bin
      [Ralph Versteegen]
    * Incremented RPG file version to 6. (Game only shows backwards
      compatability warnings when loading files in version 4 or older)
      [James Paige]

October 03 2005 [rusalka]

  * Bug-Fixes

    * Fixed bug 18: "In the map editor, CTRL+F doesn't use default
      passability" [Ralph Versteegen]

    * Fixed bug 76: "Hitting two keys at the same time allows you to
      overflow text-entry fields" [James Paige]

    * Fixed a bug that allowed argument values to pre-fill local
      variables in scripts that did not have enough arguments declared
      (It is now safe to assume that all your local variables will
      start out set to zero) [James Paige]

    * Fixed bug 81: "fight formation() with an invalid formation would
      start a battle which would immediately end" [Yuriy]

    * To bring up the Joystick calibration screen, you should now
      press CTRL+J rather than just J

    * Fixed bug 85: "menu called when exiting a script triggered menu or
      screen with ESC" [Yuriy and Ralph Versteegen]

    * Fixed bug 86: "Foot offset is not taken into account when culling
      npcs and heroes to draw onscreen" [Ralph Versteegen]

    * Fixed bug 88: "A script buffer overflow crashes or freezes game.exe
      instead of displaying an error message" [Ralph Versteegen]

    * "NPC is walking" now returns true when the NPC is walking and false
      if not walking. Used to be backwards. Old compiled scripts that
      depended on the backwards behaviour will still work as they did
      before, but you will have fixed them if you recompile them.
      [James Paige]

  * New Features

    * plotscripting commands to read system time: system hour, system
      minute, system second. [Mike Caron]

    * plotscripting commands to read system date: system day, system
      month, system year. [Yuriy]

    * plotscripting command to find out the currently playing song.
      [Mike Caron]

    * plotscripting command run script by ID which does just that
      [Ralph Versteegen]

    * status indicators (poison/stun) via characters appended to stats
      in battle [Yuriy]

    * "No reward for targets killed" bitset (useful for monsters "running
      away") [Yuriy]

    * Command to get the ASCII code of a key being pressed (last ascii())

    * importglobals behaviour extended: importglobals(slot,id) returns
      the value of a global without overwriting anything

    * Strings! Specifically:

      * New commands:
          show string(string ID)
          clear string(string ID)
          append ascii(string ID, ascii code)
          append number(string ID, number)
          copy string(dest string, source string)
          concatenate strings(dest string, source string)
          string length(string ID)
          replace char(string ID, position, ascii)
          delete char(string ID, position)
          ascii from string(string ID, position)
          string to globals(string ID, starting global, length)
          globals to string(string ID, starting global, length)
        [BIG HUGE thanks to Yuriy (Draknight2@wmconnect.com)]

      * New operators for strings:
          destid $= srcid  instead of  copy string(destid,srcid)
          destid $+ srcid  instead of  concatenate strings(destid,srcid)
        Please note that  id $+ "TESTING"  is NOT valid
        [Ralph Versteegen]

      * Commands to get useful strings:
          get hero name(string, hero)
          set hero name(string, hero)

          get map name(string, map)
          get attack name(string, attack)
          get global string(string, global)
          input string (string, use current)
        [Mike Caron]

      * Commands to display strings on the screen:
          show string at (string, x, y)
          center string at (string, x, y)
          hide string (string)
          string style (string, style)
          string color (string, color, background color)
          position string (string, x, y)
          string X (string)
          string Y (string)
        [James Paige]

       * ${S#} Meta String for textboxes

       * Support in HSpeak for "auto strings":

          $1="My string"

          That will set the string with ID 1 to "My string"

    *  get enemy name, set enemy name
       get enemy stat, set enemy stat
       get enemy appearance, set enemy appearance
       get enemy rewards, set enemy rewards
	             [Mike Caron and Yuriy]

    *  Map limit increased from 100 to 32767 maps
       [Ralph Versteegen]

    *  Transparent tile and sprite pasting in all graphics editors.
       Copy a sprite normally, then paste it with Ctrl + T. Transparent
       (colour 0) areas will not get pasted [Ralph Versteegen]

    *  You can now use capslock + directional keys to move a tile around
       like you can in the sprite editor. In the tile editor however,
       pieces of the tile that go over the edge wrap around to the other
       side  [Ralph Versteegen]

    *  Place tiles without overwriting passability with the default by
       hitting Ctrl + D when tilemapping [Ralph Versteegen]

    *  Attack bitset to ignore attacking hero's/enemy's Extra Hits
       stat [Ralph Versteegen]

    *  Plotscript command alternpc has been considerably optimised. It
       no longer reloads all npcs and heros on the map [Ralph Versteegen]

    *  New plotscript commands: get map tileset, get ambient music,
       set ambient music, allow minimap, allow save anywhere, set map
       edge mode, get map edge mode, set harm tile damage, set harm tile
       flash, get foot offset, set foot offset, get instead of battle
       script, set instead of battle script, get each step script, set
       each step script, get on keypress script, set on keypress script,
       draw npcs above heroes, map width, map height [Ralph Versteegen]

    *  New general bitsets: skip title screen, skip load screen (which
       can be set or off in any combination), pause on all battle menus
       [Ralph Versteegen]

  * Stuff only Developers Will Notice

    * Plotscripting Dictionary Documentation is now in xml format instead
      of html (but still exportable to html) [Big thanks to Mike Caron]

    * Constants for the gen()/general() array data [James Paige]

    * Combined save- and load- menus to save memory (about 3.7kb) and
      make future changes easier [Ralph Versteegen]

May 19 2005 [quaternion]

  * GPL Licensed source code. See LICENSE.txt

  * Added += and -= operators to Hspeak, thanks to a patch from
    The Mad Cacti and Fyrewulff

  * "Inns don't revive dead heroes" bitset now works on all Inns (bug 23)

  * "Level up for (hero)" and "(#) levels for (hero)" battle text is now
    customizable (bug 46)

  * Fixed misspellings of "enemies" as in plotscripting commands "suspend
    random enemies" and "resume random enemies" (Misspelled versions
    still work for backwards compatability)

  * New plotscripting commands: save in slot, last save slot, auto save,
    save slot used, import globals, export globals, load from slot,
    delete save. Thanks to Ysoft-entertainment and Ralph Versteegen
    (TeeEmCee)

  * It is now possible to display the save menu without actually saving
    using "save menu (false)"

  * New plotscripting commands: init mouse, mouse pixel x, mouse pixel
    y, mouse button, put mouse, mouse region, NPC at pixel
    Thanks to Ralph Versteegen (TeeEmCee)

  * Very nice plotscript buffer usage optimization. Scripts that run more
    than once take no extra space in the buffer, allowing you to write
    recursive scripts without fear of buffer-overflow. Thanks to Ralph
    Versteegen (TeeEmCee)

  * Bugs fixed thanks to help from Simon Bradley

    * "equip where" plotscripting command always uses hero #0's
       equipability data no matter which hero you specify

  * Bugs fixed thanks to help from Ralph Versteegen (TeeEmCee)

    * bug  1: item-based stat increases go away after level-up
    * bug 32: blank exp/gold box after battle when you earn no exp/gold
    * bug 47: Off by one bug in assigning script buffer and heap wastes
              memory
    * bug 54: Aim math text for Magic damage in CUSTOM is incorrect

  * Bugs fixed thanks to help from Mike Caron (pkmnfrk)

    * bug 40: Maps can be resized to invalid dimensions
    * bug 35: enemy spawned backwards in place of"flee-instead-of-die"...
    * bug 20: CUSTOM does no error checking for NPCs that point to text
              boxes that have been deleted
    * bug 63: Crash when trying to rename a hero not in party

  * Code cleanup (things that only developers will notice)

     * Cleaned up build system to make it possible for people other than
       me to compile if they can get ahold of a copy of QuickBasic 4.5
     * (Partial) Support for compiling with QuickBasic 7.1 thanks to Mike
       Caron (pkmnfrk) and Ralph Versteegen (TeeEmCee)
     * Massive indentation cleanup thanks to David Gowers (NeoTA)
     * Assembly DECLARE cleanup (moved to to allmodex.bi) thanks to Simon
       Bradley


June 28 2004 [ozarks]

  * Everybody who has worked so hard to try to plotscript this is
    going to simultaneously hate me and love me for this, but now
    it is possible to choose whether heroes get drawn over NPCs or
    NPCs get drawn over heroes. Look in the "General Map Data" menu

  * The general game data screen now has a separate sub-menu for
    password entry that explains the low-security nature of RPG file
    password protection.

  * Changed internal password storage format into something easier
    for third-party utility authors to support.

  * Fixed a bug that caused a crash if you typed a comma as the
    first letter of an RPG file's filename either when creating a
    new file or renaming an existing one. Totally re-wrote my
    DOS-filename-typing code so that I trust it to be reliable now

  * Added a few more missing customizable global text strings.
    "THE INN COSTS (# gold)", "You have (# gold)", "CANNOT RUN"

  * pressing ESC on the "Discard Changes and Quit?" menu cancels the
    quit rather than confirming it

  * fixed a math overflow in the "random" plotscripting command when
    the difference betweeen the low and high limits was greater than
    32767

  * Quick program exit keys PgUp+PgDown+ESC now work inside battle

  * Plotscripters rejoice! Added plotscripting commands: use shop,
    status screen, show mini map, spells menu, items menu, equip menu
    save menu, order menu, team menu

October 05 2003 [paternoster]

  * NPCs can now be activated across the edges of a wraparound
    map

  * Fixed caterpillar hero walkabout graphics to be correctly
    displayed over the edges of a wraparound map.

  * Improved the F12 BMP-format screenshot feature to take
    screen shots virtually anywhere in GAME.EXE rather than
    just on the map or in battle. Now you can take screen
    shots of menus, title screen, whatever. (no such capability
    in CUSTOM.EXE, sorry)

  * Fixed the "put hero" plotscripting command so it now works
    for all heroes instead of just the leader

  * Made the "Found a (item)" and "Found (number) (items)"
    victory captions customizable.

  * Fixed a bug that caused the PAUSE key to be disabled in
    battle if Debugging keys were disabled

  * Fixed a bug that could cause recently drawn graphics to be
    lost under certain conditions when pressing CTRL+BACKSPACE
    to delete picture sets in the sprite editor

  * Now if a hero has zero maximum HP it will not die. This
    prevents the game from ending after you exit the menu
    on games where the heros have not been given any stats
    (for example, games that do not use battles)

August 04 2003 [wolfwood]

  * Fixed the bug that premitted you to cast MP-based spells
    in battle even when you did not have enough MP

  * Fixed the bug that resets the hero's picture and palette to
    zero if the hero is renamed when added to the party

  * It is no longer possible to get invalid item 255 (item 254
    is the last item)

  * Added plotscripting commands: set victory music, get death
    script, set load script, get load script, set battle wait
    mode, set caterpillar mode, set no HP level up restore, set
    no MP level up restore, set inn no revive mode, set full
    hero swap mode, hide battle ready meter, hide battle health
    meter, set debug keys disable

July 31 2003 [espereble]

  * The Focus stat (MP-cost-reduction stat) now works

  * Fixed the bug that caused enemies that die from poison to
    vanish instantly rather than fading

  * Fixed the bug that caused the battle to end after killing any
    enemy with the boss bitset, even if other bosses or non-die-
    without-boss enemies were still alive. Also fixed the bug
    that caused die-without-boss enemies to double-die when the
    boss died if you had already killed them previously

  * Added the (optional) ability to allow players to rename heros!
    You can enable this feature for specific heros in the hero
    editor under "Bitsets". Heros can be renamed when the are
    added to the party or on the status screen.

  * Added plotscripting commands "rename hero" and "rename hero by
    slot"

  * Added the ability to embed hero names in text boxes by typeing
    special codes that will be replaced with the names.
    ${C#} is replaced by the name of the hero at position # in the
          caterpillar party. So if you want the leader's name,
          write ${C0}
    ${P#} is replaced by the name of the hero at position # in the
          party
    ${H#} is replaced by the name of the first copy of hero ID#

  * Added the ability to embed global variables in text boxes by
    typing the special code ${V#} where # is the global variable's
    ID number

  * Added plotscripting command "pick hero" that pops up a hero
    picker like the one you see when you go into the Equip menu
    or the Status menu. The return-value of this command is the
    hero that you picked (their position in the party)

  * The correct "Equip Who?" caption is now used when the Equip
    menu is opened from inside a shop

  * Added the ability to copy maps in the map editor. Now when you
    pick "Add new map" you get a choice between "New Blank Map" or
    "Copy of Map N"

  * Changed the way temporary files are cleaned up to work around
    the "...The operating system is denying access to the files in
    playing.tmp" error that occurs sometimes for some people.

  * Added "If this problem persists, manually delete playing.tmp"
    to the "...The operating system is denying access to the files in
    playing.tmp" error message (just in case the other fix doesn't
    solve all cases)

  * Fixed an off-by-one bug in the "change NPC ID" plotscripting
    command. If you were already using this command in your scripts,
    you may need to change them (it is no longer neccisary to add 1
    to the ID number, and it is no longer impossible to change the ID
    to 35)

  * Fixed the bug which caused enemies to die if cured over 32767 HP.
    I believe there are still other math-overflow errors in battle
    which could cause crashes or incorrect behavior for extremely
    strong attacks or enemies and heros with extremely high stats.
    If anybody finds such a bug, please send me a testcase.

  * I have been misspelling the word "enemies" for years. If anybody
    catches me saying "enemys" please yell at me.

  * When you switch to a different map with the same music, or enter
    a battle with different music, the song does not restart from the
    beginning, it continues playing without interruption. You can
    force a song to restart with plotscripting by doing a "stop song"
    followed by a "play song"

  * Switched back to the old version of MIDI2BAM. The new one in the
    handshake update caused more problems than it fixed.

  * Fixed a bug that occured in games that have caterpillar party
    disabled. Walking over harm tiles would damage the empty spaces
    behind the leader where other heros would have been if caterpillar
    was on.

  * Fixed a bug that caused items marked as "cannot be sold/dropped"
    to be consumed if you learn a spell from them

  * Fixed the bug that prevented the attack with ID 0 from working in
    spell lists

  * Fixed two bugs with the text-char-picker. One, that it would
    insert an extra space along with every char, and second that it
    would ignore the text-length limit

Nov 29 2002 [handshake]

  * I decree that henceforth all updates will have silly codenames.
    This update shall be known as "handshake" in thanks to everybody
    who helped me solve the NT/2000/XP bug.

  * Fixed The crash on exit in GAME.EXE under Windows NT/2000/XP
    If you still have an old locked playing.tmp file left over from
    the previous version, you may need to manually delete it once
    first before the new version will run.

  * Fixed the bug that prevented consumable items that teach spells
    from being consumed

  * Added plotscripting command "load tileset" to dynamicly change
    the tileset of the currently loaded map.

  * Fixed a crash when viewing the status screen for certain heros
    in some games (Powerstick Man, for example)

  * I neglected to mention in the last update that I added an option
    for "Base DEF stat" in the attack editor.

  * Also, In the last update I mistakenly said the text-char picker
    thingy was bought up by pressing ALT+SPACE. This was not true, it
    was actually SHIFT+SPACE, but in this update I have changed it to
    CTRL+SPACE, because SHIFT+SPACE was so easy to accadentally trigger
    when TYPING A LINE IN ALL CAPS (is everyone sufficiently confused
    now?)

Nov 23 2002

  * Made the text "(hero) has no spells" customizable. Are there any
    more text strings that I missed?

  * Fixed the mini-map when shown from a shop so it works like the
    mini-map from the menu or F1

  * Added an attack target type that can only target dead heros.

  * Added pixel-perfect positioning plotscripting commands; put hero,
    put npc, put camera, hero pixel x, hero pixel y, NPC pixel x, NPC
    pixel y, camera pixel x, camera pixel y

  * Fixed a bug that caused the hero to become misaligned with the
    maptiles if you tried to mount a vehicle that was already moving

  * Added "Save and continue editing" to the "Exit" menu.

  * GAME.EXE and CUSTOM.EXE can now both detect when you attempt to
    run a second instance of the program without first closing the
    first.

  * Added plotscripting commands "hero by slot" and "hero by rank"
    which are the opposites of "find hero" and "rank in caterpillar"

  * Added plotscripting commands "teach spell", "forget spell",
    "read spell", "write spell", "knows spell", and "can learn spell"

  * Added a caption when you teach a hero a spell from an item

  * Updated HSPEAK.EXE to tolerate the corrupted line-endings
    sometimes inserted into scripts under Windows XP

  * Due to popular demand, set-to-percentage type attacks now display
    the difference between the old and new value of the target stat
    (use the "do not display damage" bitset if you want the old
    behavior)

  * Added an attack bitset for damage that is calculated and displayed
    but not actually inflicted. Good for "scan" type spells

  * Elemental bitsets on equipment now works

  * Added Elemental Strength/Weakness display to the Status screen in
    GAME.EXE. Press the "Use" key to toggle it on and off. Press the
    "Cancel" key to exit status.

  * Added Poison, Regen, and Stun afflictions in battle. To use them,
    create attacks that target the new "Affliction Register" target
    stats. For example, damage done to the Poison Register will be
    repeated as poison damage. Damage done to the Stun Register will
    become the number of seconds that the target is stunned. There is
    currently no visual indicator of afflictions! That will be added
    later.

  * Greatly improved the font editor. You can now edit 224 text
    characters, copy and paste, and import/export font files. Added
    three importable sample fonts in the IMPORT directory, ASCII,
    Japanese, and Cyrillic.

  * Added a character-picker accessable from any text-entry
    field by pressing ALT+SPACE [Edit: CTRL+SPACE]

  * Added "Import New Master Palette" feature to "General Game Data"
    menu. Now you can directly import new palettes created with Neo's
    PalEdit and 2MAS utilites (note that importing a new palette screws
    up all your existing graphics, so this is only really useful for
    new RPG files)

  * Various memory optimizations, in an attempt to further
    reduce the "Not Enough Conventional DOS Memory" threshhold.

  * Fixed the "set default weapon" plotscripting command

  * Fixed the broken "Require Tag" feature in shops

  * Fixed the crash that could occur after reloading the
    default passability of a large map.

  * Fixed bugs involving showing the tileset in GAME.EXE. If you spot
    any more situations where a tileset displays, a backdrop fails to
    display, or a map fails to reappear after a backdrop, please let
    me know

  * Fixed the bug that made it impossible for a script containing a
    "wait for key" command to terminate when run on a map with an
    on-keypress script active .

  * Fixed the on-keypress script handler so you can hold down a key
    without suspending all your other scripts. I am pretty sure that
    this will not break anybody's existing on-keypress scripts, but
    do let me know if you have any problems.

  * Fixed a bug where if you were holding down a key and then tapped
    a second key without releasing the first key, the on-keypress
    script handler would not be triggered even though the first key
    was still down

  * Fixed an obscure plotscripting error that could cause strange
    behavior after running a _very_ big script.

  * Various trivial bugfixes

Feb 27 2002

  * The last sound fix solved the problem for some people, but not
    everyone. Hopefully this willget sound back the way it was in
    June 11 2002

Feb 25 2002

  * Scrounged around to free up a K or two of memory to lower the
    "Not Enough Conventional DOS Memory" threshhold, which has been
    slowly creeping upwards as I add features

  * Fixed a bug that cause the map tileset to be displayed if you brought
    up the menu while a "show backdrop" plotscripting command was active

  * Fixed the bug that prevented NPCs from being drawn over the edges
    of wraparound maps

  * Scrapped the changes to the music-setup that did card autodetection
    and INI reading altogether. They broke music for many people, and I
    did not get one single report of them fixing music for anybody.
    The soundcard is now blindly detected exactly as it was back in the
    June 11 2001 version

Feb 19 2002

  * A change in the soundcard code that will hopefully fix the new
    sound problems introduced in the last update. (if it doesnt, I
    will regress to the June 11 2001 sound code.)

  * Yet-another-fix for the "Dont restore HP/MP at levelup" feature,
    which has probably been the most buggy feature in the history of
    the whole program. I am fairly confident I got it right this time :)

Feb 14 2002

  * Fixed a bug that caused wait commands under certain circumstances
    to wait one game cycle longer than they needed to. This should
    make some complex plotscripts run a little smoother

  * Fixed a bug that prevented you from getting items from battle if you
    impatiently held down the button to skip the victory messages

  * Joystick calibration info is now saved and restored to the file
    JOYSET.INI so you do not have to re-calibrate each time you play.
    Note that the joystick will still not be activated unless you use
    a joystick button to advance the title-screen of a game

  * Added a menu option in the map editor to re-load the default
    passability for the entire map

  * Saved games now correctly save and restore the positions of all four
    heros, rather than just the leader.

  * Fixed a bug introduced in the June 8 2001 version that caused
    plotscripts to lock up if you attempted to use a "wait for NPC"
    command on an NPC who didnt actually exist on the map.

  * Implemented stealing. To try it out, make an attack with the
    "Steal item" bitset turned on, and make sure to give your enemys
    some stealable items in the enemy editor.

  * Changed the F6 debug key. Now instead of uselessly panning the camera
    to the center of the map, holding the F6 keys allows you to pan the
    camera freely with the arrow keys (F5 to return to the hero)

  * Added error checking for accessing out-of-range global script
    variables (variables with ID numbers higher than 1024)

  * Brian fixed the ASM code for importing BMP files so imported sprites
    no longer lose their rightmost row of pixels. Yay!

  * Re-wrote the Attack Menu and the Enemy Menu to save memory and make
    future alterations easyer. Any small differences you see in these menus
    are a result of the rewrite

  * Re-enabled copy and paste while editing graphics with CTRL+C and
    CTRL+V. Moved palette copying and pasting back to ALT+C and ALT+V

  * Added Attack Captions that can display at the bottom of the screen
    when you use an attack

  * Re-fixed the "Do not Restore HP on Levelup" bug that had
    resurfaced AGAIN. Added lots of comments to the code to prevent me
    from messing it up again :)

  * Added the ability to unequip one item at a time

  * Fixed the bug that prevented the default weapon for being equiped when
    you unequip a weapon with a plotscript

  * Greatly improved crash trapping. If GAME.EXE or CUSTOM.EXE crash
    they will now display useful error messages and terminate cleanly,
    rather than the old behavior of garbling the screen and locking up :)

  * Fixed a crasher in the item menu in GAME.EXE when you moved the cursor
    to the right from the very bottom of the menu

  * GAME.EXE can now read an alternate address to search for a soundcard.
    To try this out, download http://HamsterRepublic.com/dl/bam_port.zip
    and read the included .TXT file. (I expect that this will only
    help a very small subset of troubled BAM users)

  * Fixed the bug that prevented heros fourth spell list from working
    if it was set to type: Random

  * Almost every single menu in CUSTOM now supports PGUP PGDN HOME END and
    wraparound (the only noticeable exception is the stat menu in the
    hero editor)

  * Password entry is now starred-out to protect from spys who peek over
    your shoulder

  * Expanded the "Edit Global Text Strings" menu to allow you to change
    every bit of text in your game. Let me know if I missed anything.
    (and I probably did miss a few things)

  * Fixed bug that caused the game to appear to lock up if you pressed the
    menu key right when you walked through a door (the menu was appearing
    and blocking the fade-in)

June 11 2001

  * Repaired the glaring bug in the last version that caused corruption
    in the graphics editor when the UNDO buffer overflowed (and in the
    process, found a way to make the UNDO buffer 5 times bigger :)

  * Expanded the "Edit Stat Names" menu to become the "Edit Global Strings"
    menu that gives you the ability to change many other fixed-text strings
    in GAME.EXE. Eventually all strings should be customizable, but this
    will be a gradual process over the next few updates

June 8 2001

  * Cleaned up the hero spell list editor into a two-column menu where
    you can actually type in all the values

  * You can now type in the enemy number in the formation editor

  * Improved map-picking menu to show long map names and support
    PGUP and PGDN

  * Fixed bug that prevented music from playing when you quit and reload
    a saved game on a map with the same music

  * Fixed battle lockup when "pause on battle menus" is enabled and a
    hero dies when a menu is up.

  * Added a vehicle bitset to disable the shadow when you are flying

  * Updated the plotscript compiler to support := as an alternate to
    "set variable" (If for some strange reason you are still using the
    old HSPEAK version 1, this might cause some compatability problems.
    If you are using the old HSPEAK let me know, and I will help)

  * fixed a crasher caused by passing an out-of-range NPC ID to certain
    plotscripting commands

  * fixed a bug that prevented tag-dependant NPCs from immediately
    appearing after their tag changed

  * fixed a bug that could cause NPCs to get stuck mid-movement when you
    bring up the menu or a text-box

  * Added two plotscripting commands for getting NPC references which you
    can store in variables for later use with most other NPC-related
    commands. Manipulating NPCs by reference is faster than manipulating
    them by ID, and references allow you to manipulate any copy of an NPC
    not just the first one on the map. The new commands are "NPC reference"
    and "NPC at spot"

  * Updated the following plotscripting commands to accept NPC references
    in addition to NPC ID numbers: waitfornpc,setNPCframe,camerafollowsNPC,
    NPCx,NPCy,walkNPC,setNPCdirection,setNPCposition,NPCdirection,
    NPCiswalking,walkNPCtoX, and walkNPCtoY. AlterNPC and setNPCspeed do
    _not_ support NPC references because they both change data that is the
    same for every copy of the same NPC on the map

  * Added new plotscripting commands getNPCid,NPCcopycount,changeNPCID,
    createNPC, destroyNPC, useNPC, and getherolevel. See the plotscripting
    dictionary for more info.

  * Added an UNDO feature to the Maptile editor and the Sprite editor
    (keyboard shortcut CTRL+Z for both)

  * Fixed several plotscipting commands that accept values returned
    by "find hero". When "find hero" cannot find a particular hero
    it returns -1. several commands were treating the -1 like a 0,
    and therefore affecting the leader when the should have been
    doing nothing at all. If you have a script that used to work fine
    but stops working right in this version, check that you are
    correctly using the "find hero" command

  * PAUSE key no longer behaves like the USE key

  * Fixed a crasher in the Equip menu in games that have no items.

  * Fixed broken "suspendoverlay" and "resumeoverlay" plotscripting
    commands

  * An assortment of other minor fixes

May 22 2001

  * Added scancode.hsi plotscript include file that contains friendly
    names for the scancodes for use with "key is pressed"

  * Fixed a bug that allowed you to start a new game without triggering
    the new-game script if the first save slot was empty but another save
    slot had been used

  * You can now import entire tilesets from 24-bit BMP files just like
    you import backdrops

  * Under Windows 9X/ME/NT/2K (and also OpenDOS and _maybe_ OS/2),
    CUSTOM.EXE can now read filenames longer than 8 letters when
    browsing BAM and BMP and HS files to import. Long filenames for
    RPG files are still  _not_ supported.

  * Added new debugging key F10 that shows plotscript interpreter
    status.

  * Added plotscripting commands "hero is walking", "NPC is walking"

  * Fixed spelling of "suspend caterpillar" and "resume caterpillar"
    plotscripting commands. the old misspelled versions still work for
    backwards compatability

  * Added load-game plotscript trigger so you can choose a plotscript
    that will automatically be run every time you load a saved game

  * Added three map-specific plotscript triggers, instead-of-battle,
    each-step, and on-keypress.

  * Added a chapter on different ways to trigger a plotscript to
    plotscripttutor.html

  * Fixed the hero-is-leader tag

  * Fixed an error that caused "script # became stateless" (and other
    errors) when scripts where double-activated

  * Fixed a bug in the "set hero picture" command that bounded the max
    walkabout picture you could set your hero to by the max number of
    hero battle pictures

  * Misc small bugfixes

April 5 2001

  * Added a nice 16-color-palette-browser that you can use top pick
    your palette. In the sprite editor it is accessed by clicking on the
    palette number or pressing P. You can also use it in the hero, enemy
    attack, item and NPC editors by pressing ENTER on the palette number

  * Fixed a bug-that-made-me-feel-very-stupid that was causing the
    hero picture/palette setting commands crash

  * Fixed palette-preview bugs in the NPC editor and the Attack editor

  * Fixed the "dont hide hero" vehicle bitset

  * Fixed a bug when using the CAPSLOCK key to choose a tile in maptile
    mode when the tile you where picking was animating

  * CUSTOM.EXE will now correctly load and use an altered master palette
    if your RPG file contains one (there is currently no built-in support
    for changing the master palette, but there are third-party utils that
    can change it)

  * Added a nag-screen to CUSTOM to remind people to make backup copies
    of their work, in the hopes that future data-lost tragedies might
    be averted :(

March 31 2001

  * Added plotscripting commands: set hero picture, get hero picture
    set hero palette, get hero palette, read global, write global

  * Maximum 16-color palettes is now 32767 instead of 99. (and they
    take less memory than before too!) This change required a total
    rewrite of the palette handling system, so be on the lookout for
    palette related bugs and report anything you find.

  * Fixed scrolling/clipping problems in the map editor after
    resizing or deleting a map

  * GAME.EXE no longer crashes trying to open a read-only RPG file
    (this means it should now be possible to play RPG files off a
    CD-ROM)

  * Fixed the bug that prevented files from showing up when their
    "Archive" bit was turned off

  * Fixed a bug in HSPEAK.EXE that caused it to compile to the wrong
    output file when you tried to compile a script file with no filename
    extension

  * If GAME.EXE fails to find OHRRPGCE.FNT then it loads the system
    8x8 ROM font instead

  * GAME.EXE shows its version number on the file-select screen

  * really fixed the "dont restore HP/MP on levelup" bitsets. Honest!
    I tested it! both on and off! It really finally works the way it is
    supposed to! ... I hope :)

Feb 27 2001

  * After battle, gold and experience only display if you actually earn
    more than zero

  * Added a battle formation preview in the formation set editor

  * Typing in a number in the formation set editor is no longer
    off by 1

  * Ally-including-dead target type now works outside of battle

  * If two heros use the same item at the same time in battle, only
    the first one will succeed and the item count will not go negative

  * Fixed a menu bug in the shop editor when a shop contains both
    items and heros

  * double-triggering a script that is already currently running now
    silently fails without displaying an error message or interrupting
    the running script

  * Added a general preference bitset to permit double-triggering
    of a script that is already currently running (a good way to make
    your game crash if you dont know what you are doing :)

  * PageUP and PageDOWN work on the item editing menu in CUSTOM

  * Larger animation buffer in battle to avoid lockups like the one
    in ORIGIN

  * Fixed reversed "Horizontal" and "Vertical" NPC pushability types

  * No longer able to name non-existant tags over 999

  * Fixed a longstanding bug that caused scripts to crash if you tried
    to return() a value

  * fixed hero's fourth spell menu

  * correctly handle case-insenstive name conflicts in exported HSI files

  * Fixed equipwhere plotscripting command

  * Heros are now correctly Y-sorted

  * NPCs with zero speed do not get stuck when forced to move

  * You can now set default pasability data in the maptile editor that
    will automatically be applied to tiles as you place them on the map.
    Regular wallmapping-mode in the map editor is still available unchanged
    for making exceptions and fine tuning your pasability.

  * A new, much faster, better optimizing, version of the HSPEAK.EXE
    plotscript compiler (HssED has also been updated)

  * Added 13 more classical songs to the free BAM collection,
    thanks to JD Shear

  * Fixed RPGFIX.EXE to run in true DOS

  * a few misc trivial fixes that nobody will notice

December 9 2000

  * Enlarged the collection of free BAM music, with many thanks to
    Shael Riley

  * Added Text-search in the Text Box editor

  * Strengthened error-checking for corrupted data

  * Fixed a lockup bug in the hero appearance menu

  * Fixed bug that prevented the "dont restore HP on levelup" and
    "Dont restore MP on levelup" bitsets from working properly

  * Announces when you learn a new spell from a levelup

  * You can get multiple levelups after one battle if you earn enough
    experience

  * Added new damage base-stats "previous attack", "Last damage to
    attacker" and "Last damage to target"

  * Added new target classes "Revenge (last hit)", "Revenge (Whole Battle)",
    "Previous Target" and "Stored Target"

  * Added attack bitset "Store Target" that memorizes the target for use
    with later "Stored Target" class attacks.

  * Added attack bitset "Autotarget" that picks a target automatically
    when used by a hero

  * Percentage damage now displays the amount it changed the target stat
    (unless the "Do Not Show Damage" bitset is turned on)

  * Cancelling a BMP import import in the sprite editor no longer
    asks the palette question

  * Fixed missing spread-ally-not-self and spread-ally-including-dead
    enemy attack settings

  * Fixed a bug that could occasionally cause attacks targeting heros to
    fail randomly under certain circumstances

  * Fixed a bug that prevented Rare Items from showing up after battle

  * In CUSTOM.EXE you can now browse your Tag names by typing in their
    number instead of scrolling through them all. (People with tag names
    in existing games will need to scroll through them once before it will
    work)

  * When GAME.EXE is run, it checks its own filename. If it has been
    renamed to anything other than GAME.EXE then it will automatically try
    to load an RPG file of the same name from the same directory. This
    means if your game's name is QUEST.RPG then you can distribute a copy
    of GAME.EXE renamed to QUEST.EXE together with it and make it nice and
    easy for users to run your game

  * GAME.EXE no longer requires OHRRPGCE.MAS (but CUSTOM.EXE still needs it)

  * Supressed the warning if OHRRPGCE.FNT is missing when you start a
    specific RPG file from the command-line or from a renamed GAME.EXE
    (although without OHRRPGCE.FNT, the "Loading..." wont appear)

  * Fixed a bug in the "check tag" plotscripting command so that it returns
    1 when the tag is true instead of -1

  * Fixed a bug in damage calculation that caused defence to used
    incorrectly in "Sharp", "Blunt", and "Pure" attacks

  * Added a bitset to simulate the old Level-up bug found in very old
    versions of GAME.EXE and a debugging key (F7) to turn it off and on.
    This helps for playing old obsolete games like FUABMX that depended on
    the bug for proper difficulty... or you can also enable it if you
    happen to be making a game that would benefit from heros equipment
    bonuses getting merged into their stats whenever you get a levelup.
    Are you happy, Rya? :)

  * Added new debugging keys F8 and F9 to raw-edit the gen() and gmap()
    data. This isnt likely to mean anything to anybody but me, but it can
    be fun to mess with it and try to crash your game :)

Sept 15 2000

  * Added plotscripting commands unequip,forceequip,equipwhere,
    checkequipment,getdefaultweapon, setdefaultweapon, and rankincaterpillar

  * Fixed an embarassingly stupid error in the "NPC direction" command

  * Joystick buttons now behave more like keyboard keys.

  * Tag-debug mode now lets you turn tags OFF with CTRL- and ON with CTRL+

  * Changing maps while a background is displaying no longer displays the
    tileset

  * Riding a vehicle that has door use disabled does not disable the
    "use door" plotscripting command, or doors that are forced by
    text boxes

  * Debugging keys can be disabled by a bitset in the General game Data
    menu.

  * Added two debugging keys to battle mode CTRL+F4 instantly runs from any
    battle, and CTRL+F5 gives you a million experience points

  * Fixed a longstanding bug that affected both the usedoor and the
    teleporttomap plotscripting commands, that caused "noop" errors in
    certain circumstances-- Woo! I have been hunting for that one for
    SOOOO long! It feels great to fix it! ... Hope I didnt create any
    new bugs in the process :)

  * the teleporttomap plotscripting command takes its coordinates
    in maptiles now, not pixels (adjust your scripts accordingly, sorry
    for the inconvenience)

  * GAME.EXE no longer leaves behind STACK.TMP in your TEMP directory

  * If you try to import a .HS file that is not really a compiled
    plotscript, CUSTOM.EXE now displays a helpful and slightly sarcastic
    error message instead of crashing

  * Added a pretty ready-meter and a health-meter to battle mode

  * Names and menus dissapear after you win a battle, while it shows
    you your winnings and levelups

  * Displays the correct name for "MP" on the spell select screen

  * Enemy's "harmed by cure" bitset no longer applies to absorbing
    elemental damage

  * Fixed lockup when trying to trigger a random battle from a completely
    empty formation set

  * Attacks can now have any stat as a "Base Stat" or "Target Stat"
    The "Damage MP" bitset is now obsolete, but still works for backwards
    compatability

  * New Attack Bitsets; "Absorb Damage", "Do not Randomize"
    "Damage can be Zero", "Reset target stat to max before hit",
    "Allow cure to exceed maximum", "Do not display damage",
    "Show attack name", "Fail vs Elemental Resistance", and
    "Fail vs Enemy Type"

  * New attack types that set the target stat to a percentage (intended for
    near-kill spells, cure-all spells, spells that modify stats, etc.)

  * Fixed a bug that could cause file bloat when pressing PGUP and PGDN
    under certain curcumstances in the sprite editor

  * Correctly checks for OHRRPGCE.MAS and OHRRPGCE.FNT and exits gracefully
    if they are missing

May 28 2000

  * Added "After battle" plotscript, which can take a single argument
    which is true if you won and false if you ran from the battle

  * Screen shots taken with F12 are now stored in the same directory
    as the RPG file

  * Added a progress meter for loading especially large directories

  * Now correctly cleans up temporary files when you quit a game and load
    another

  * Fixed a bug that sometimes caused scripts to interfere with each other
    (the intro in Wandering Hamster works again)

  * Fixed the bug that caused vehicles of speed 10 to freeze

  * When activating an NPC that changes tags, the tag changes no longer
    take effect instantly, they wait for the text box.

  * Added plotscripting functions herodirection and NPCdirection

May 8 2000

  * Vehicle support! Mark your map with A and B tiles in wallmapping mode,
    then set any NPC to one of the predefined vehicle types, or create
    your own vehicle types.

  * Converted HOWTO from text to html (with pictures!). There is still
    a text version, based on the html version

  * Added plotscript commands; dismountvehicle,iskeypressed,readmapblock
    readpassblock,writemapblock,writepassblock

  * waitforkeypress(anykey) plotscripting command now returns the value
    of the pressed key

  * Added an "After-Battle" plotscript in the "general map data" menu
    that automatically sends true/false for its first argument based
    on if you ran from battle. Also made the fightformation plotscripting
    command return true if you ran from battle, false if you won

  * Fixed a bug that caused the game timer stop if you where playing
    at midnight.

  * Maximum tag number is now 999 instead of 500

  * Fixed a bug that prevented one-time usable NPCs from dissapearing
    if they did not trigger a text box

  * Added an "EXIT" button to the "Load Game" screen in GAME.EXE for the
    benefit of people who dont instinctively know to press ESC to get out
    of DOS games

  * Screen-shots taken by GAME.EXE with F12 are now patched for
    MS-paint compatability (grumble)

  * Sprite editor now lets you go up to 99 palettes instead of 90

  * Adjusted levelup calculation, and fixed starting-experience bug
    for heros added at levels higher than 1

  * Fixed a bug in the "resume hero walls" plotscripting command

  * Fixed a big bug in the "while" looping command for plotscripting
    now it is possible to use a while loop that iterates more than once
    without crashing and burning :)

  * You can give your game a long title and "about" information that will
    be displayed instead of the filename when browsing for RPG files

January 31 2000

  * GAME.EXE now keeps track of how long you have played a game.
    This is displayed on the save/load screens instead of HP

  * Days, hours, and minutes of gameplay are available to plotscripts
    via the plotscripting functions: days of play, hours of play,
    minutes of play

  * Heros and NPCs are no longer drawn 5 pixels up from the maptiles.
    You can now set a custom "Foot Offset" for each map

  * File browser now alphabetizes file listings
    (only by the first letter, for speed)

  * BMP files of the wrong size and bit depth now show up greyed-out
    in the import browser

  * The PlotScript interpreter is now more resistant to being crashed
    by bad scripts

  * Fixed cursor glytch while picking tiles in tilemap mode

  * Fixed the swapped menu items in the graphics menu

January 25 2000

  * Reorganised the main menu, and put al graphics-related stuff in an
    "Edit Graphics" submenu

  * You can now make tiles on a map damage your hero when you step on them.
    Press H in wallmap mode to place Harm-Tiles. (default damage is zero)

  * The If-tag-set-tag conditional for text boxes can now set two tags
    instead of just one. In making this change, I removed the
    "If tag then stop" conditional, as it was pretty much completely
    useless, and as far as I know nobody ever used it. If anyone out
    there did actually use it, I appologise for the inconvenience.

  * The airbrush tool in the MapTile editor can no longer wrap over the
    edge of the screen and mess up other tiles.

  * Yay! The mapeditor in wallmapping mode no longer flickers in a
    seisure-inducing way. Yay!

  * Eliminated OHRRPGCE.ALL and OHRRPGCE.PAL. These files are no longer
    needed to run custom.exe.

  * Fixed the bug that resulted in corrupt map data after deleting a map,
    and repaired Map 0 in the default new-game.

  * Fixed a bug that would cause CUSTOM.EXE to lock while exporting an HSI
    file if you gave something a name that ended with a very long number.

  * Fixed some crashes in the Shop Stuff editor

December 21 1999

  * Re-fixed the running-scripts-from-text-boxes bug.
    Deja-vu! I couldve sworn I fixed that already :P

December 19 1999

  * The HamsterSpeak syntax for math and comparison has changed.
    If you have a script that uses the old style of commands
    it will not compile correctly. See hamsterspeak.html and
    plotdictionary.html for details

  * Added the following plotscripting commands:
    getherostat, setherostat, setNPCspeed, suspendboxadvance,
    resumeboxadvance, advancebox, setheroframe, setNPCframe

  * Fixed bugs in the following plotscripting commands:
    addhero, swapouthero, swapinhero, lockhero, unlockhero

  * Global script variables are now stored in savegames

  * Autodetection and repair of corrupted maps

  * When you create a new text box, it takes its default appearance
    from text box 0

  * You can now set a hero's default level to "Party Average"

  * TAB characters are now allowed in plotscripts

  * HSPEAK.EXE now runs in DOS (for real this time :)

November 17 1999

  * Fixed the bug that stripped scripts from the text boxes that where
    supposed to trigger them

  * Fixed the bug in the "wait for hero" plotscripting command

  * I had to restore from a backup copy of my code, and a few commands
    present in the buggy November 12 update have not been reimplemented,
    namely, findhero, swapspecifichero, setherostat, and getherostat

November 11 1999

  * Reduced the conventional memory requirements of GAME.EXE and CUSTOM.EXE
    Im not happy about the way I had to do this, but too many people where
    getting DOS memory errors.

November 10 1999

  * Fixed the bug in CUSTOM.EXE that sometimes caused animating maptiles to
    crash the program

  * Fixed the bug that prevented one-time-usable NPCs from disappearing
    after you use them

November 9 1999

  * Plotscripting!
    For more information, view plotscripttutor.html, plotdictionary.html
    and hamsterspeak.html. I have also included the source for the
    plotscripts in Wandering Hamster so you can look at them for examples

  * fixed the nasty, but simple bug that used to cause GAME.EXE to crash
    on maps numbered above 39

  * CUSTOM.EXE now runs some checks on an RPG file before it will save it
    to help prevent corruption

  * Joystick support that actually works! Press J to calibrate at any time.

  * You can now link together Text boxes without going into the conditionals
    screen

  * The conditionals screen for text boxes is now much easyer to look at.
    Disabled conditions are greyed out
    "Always" conditionals appear in blue
    normal conditionals appear in brown

  * Quiting, or dying in battle now takes you back to the title screen,
    not all the way to the game select screen.

  * You can make your map display a default tile beyond its borders
    instead of usinging the camera to crop the edges. This way you can have
    a map where your hero is always in the center of the screen, no matter
    how close you come to the edges.

  * You can make your map wrap at the edges, so if you walk off one side,
    you automatically go to the other side. Great for overworld maps!
    (NPCs no not wrap)

  * GAME.EXE now prints an error message instead of locking if it cant find
    OHRRPGCE.MAS or OHRRPGCE.FNT

  * Consumable items that trigger text boxes are actually consumed now

  * You can give names to your Maps.
    these names can optionally be displayed when you enter a map,
    and the name of the map that you saved on will be displayed
    on the save/load screens
    (your existing maps may start with gibberish names that you will
     have to replace. this does not affect new maps)

  * If you use hero swapping to remove all of the living heros from a
    party, leaving an active party of all-dead heros, one of them will
    automatically pop back to life with 1 HP

  * When CUSTOM.EXE finds and attempts to recover unlumped data, it will
    save it with a .BAK extention instead of overwriting the existing
    .RPG file

  * assorted minor/frivolous/gratuitous bugfixes that you wont notice

Aug 26 1999

  * Repaired a bug in RPG file unlumping

  * Eliminated the delay after text boxes (actually just vastly reduced it)

  * Improved built-in Sprite editor and built-in Maptile editor.
    Added circle tool and airbrush. thanks to IronHoof for both

  * Assorted Small bugfixes

July 8 1999

  * Fixes the bug in the July 5 version that causes GAME.EXE to crash when
    you try to save. I cant believe I let that one slip past me! Argh!

  * Fixes a problem some people had with the "Do I have this item?" tags

  * A new feature has been added to several parts of CUSTOM.EXE that lets
    you delete all records after the current record. For example, RPG files
    created with older versions of custom.exe have 999 text boxes, even if
    you have not put any text in any of them. By erasing extra data you can
    fix the problem that some people experience with undefined heros, enemies
    or items getting filled with copies of the last hero/enemy/item you made.
    It can also slightly reduce the size of your RPG file.
    To use this feature, find the last record (last hero, last text box,
    last whatever) and press CTRL+BACKSPACE. this feature works for:
     -text boxes
     -hero data
     -item data
     -enemy data
     -attack data
     -enemy formations
     -map tile sets
     -imported backgrounds
     -all sprite graphics
     -shops

  * Maximum enemy definitions increased from 500 to 32767
    Maximum attack definitions increased from 200 to 32767
    Maximum enemy formations increased from 1000 to 32767
    Maximum map tile sets increased from 15 to 32767
    Maximum shops sets increased from 255 to 32767
    Maximum of all types of sprites increased to 32767
    (note that making 32767 hero sprites would be silly, because the limit
     for heros is still 40, and will remain 40 in the forseeable future)

  * If you buy/hire everything in a shop and there is nothing left,
    you get knocked out of the shop (instead of giving you an unlimited
    free supply of the first item)

    represents a text box.

  * Browsing for files in CUSTOM.EXE no longer crashes under real DOS

    party, is the leader, is alive, or is in your currently active
    party

  * You can assign tags to be automatically set when you own at least one
    of a particular item, have that item in your inventory, have that
    item equiped, or have that item equiped on a hero you are currently
    using

  * Small, but important bugfix. In the July 26 copy, your
