The repository for the video game Sword of Jade. This repository contains everything you need to edit, compile, and package/publish a working copy of the game.

The binary files are GPL licensed. Please see the README files for where to obtain sources and more information. The game runs on the OHRRPGCE engine, a free engine geared towards making RPG style games.

The data for Sword of Jade (either represented as sword-of-jade.rpgdir or sword-of-jade.rpg) is -NOT- GPL. However, you are free to edit, remix, change or update Sword of Jade as you see fit, as long as you clarify that your version is not officially endorsed and is non-canon. If we feel your usage of Sword of Jade is harmful to us or the game, we reserve the right to ask your version to be taken down and/or removed.

Please note that due to how the game was developed, the music soundtracks in the game are all under various methods of licensing. While we have permission to distribute the tracks with the game as of December 15, 2018, this permission does not automatically extend to third party distributions. 

Please also note that this game should not be considered a demo of the OHRRPGCE engine capabilities. The game was started in 1998 and released for the 2005 version of the engine, which still only officially ran on MS-DOS at the time. For example, maps in the game only have two layers, and there are no overhead per-pixel transparent graphics used - the modern version of the engine supports tons of map layers, tilesets, and per-pixel overhead tiles. The engine didn't even support arbitarily placing sprites back then - it does now. And that's just scratching the surface of what's capable these days.
