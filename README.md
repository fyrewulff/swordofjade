Welcome to the Github repo for Sword of Jade: Parallel Dreams, which is a full length RPG made in the OHRRPGCE engine.

Sword of Jade is created by Kevin 'Charbile' Loan and Michael 'FyreWulff' Kidder, (c)1998-2025.

Sword of Jade is available for purchase on Steam and Itch:

https://store.steampowered.com/app/1885860/Sword_of_Jade_Parallel_Dreams/

https://fyrewulff.itch.io/sword-of-jade-parallel-dreams

The OHRRPGCE engine source code can be found at https://github.com/ohrrpgce 

In the near future SoJ will be made available on other stores and platforms (EGS, Xbox, etc).

While it's possible to obtain and assemble a fully playable version of the game from this repo, I do ask nicely for you to
buy the game from one of the storefronts to support the release. The game is DRM free and the original engine is open source,
which is why I'm not making any active attempt to hide this Github repo while the game is being actively sold.

I do ask that you not link this repo across the public internet as an option to download the game for now, so that I don't have
to make it private.

Please note that if you do decide to pursue the free path, I cannot provide technical or game guide support for the game. It should also be 
noted that the build on this repo will often be broken or have weird/broken content in it and should never be considered 'stable'.
Only the versions on the stores at any time are the stable versions.
